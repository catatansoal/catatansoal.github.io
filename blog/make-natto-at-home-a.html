Ever heard of natto? It's this super unique Japanese dish made from fermented soybeans. It's got a strong smell and flavor that some people find… interesting, but it's also packed with nutrients and a staple in Japanese cuisine. If you're feeling adventurous and want to try making it at home, you've come to the right place! This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from the history and health benefits of natto to a step-by-step recipe and tips for success. So, let's dive in and learn how to make natto like a pro!</p>
<h2>What is Natto?</h2>
<p>Let's start with the basics: <strong>what exactly <em>is</em> natto</strong>? Natto is a traditional Japanese dish made from soybeans that have been fermented with a specific bacteria called <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>. This fermentation process gives natto its distinctive characteristics: a powerful, pungent aroma, a sticky and stringy texture, and a strong, savory flavor. It might sound a bit intimidating, but trust me, it's an acquired taste that many people, including myself, absolutely love!</p>
<p>The <em>fermentation process</em> is key to natto's unique properties and nutritional benefits. During fermentation, the <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> bacteria break down the proteins and sugars in the soybeans, creating new compounds that contribute to natto's flavor and texture. This process also increases the bioavailability of certain nutrients, making them easier for your body to absorb. Natto is typically eaten as a breakfast food in Japan, often served over rice and mixed with other ingredients like soy sauce, mustard, and Japanese bunching onions. It’s also gaining popularity worldwide as a healthy and delicious addition to a balanced diet.</p>
<p>The history of natto is as fascinating as the dish itself. Its origins are somewhat shrouded in mystery, with several competing theories about how it came to be. One popular legend suggests that natto was discovered by chance around 1083 AD, when the Japanese warrior Minamoto no Yoshiie and his troops were cooking boiled soybeans for their horses. Some of the beans were accidentally stored in rice-straw bags, where they fermented due to the natural presence of <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> on the straw. The soldiers, discovering the fermented beans, found them surprisingly palatable, and thus, natto was born. This story highlights the role of chance and resourcefulness in the discovery of many traditional foods. While the exact origins are debated, natto has been a part of Japanese cuisine for centuries and remains a beloved dish today. It represents a connection to Japan's culinary past and continues to evolve in modern kitchens and restaurants around the world.</p>
<h2>Health Benefits of Natto</h2>
<p>Okay, so natto might have a strong smell, but it's also a nutritional powerhouse! There are so many <em>health benefits of natto</em>, making it a fantastic addition to your diet. Let's explore some of the key reasons why you should consider adding this fermented soybean dish to your meals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rich in Nutrients:</strong> Natto is packed with essential nutrients, including protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It's an excellent source of vitamin K2, which is crucial for bone health and blood clotting. It also provides iron, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, all vital for maintaining overall health and well-being. Including natto in your diet can contribute significantly to meeting your daily nutrient requirements.</li>
<li><strong>High in Protein:</strong> As a soybean-based food, natto is a complete protein source, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids that your body needs but cannot produce on its own. Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting muscle growth, and maintaining a healthy metabolism. For vegetarians and vegans, natto can be a valuable source of plant-based protein.</li>
<li><strong>Probiotic Powerhouse:</strong> The fermentation process gives natto its probiotic punch. It’s teeming with beneficial bacteria, particularly <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, which can improve gut health. Probiotics support a healthy digestive system by promoting a balanced gut microbiome, which is crucial for nutrient absorption, immune function, and overall well-being. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to numerous health benefits, including improved digestion, enhanced immune response, and even mental health.</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin K2 Content:</strong> One of natto's standout features is its high concentration of vitamin K2. This vitamin plays a critical role in bone health by helping to direct calcium to the bones rather than accumulating in the arteries. Vitamin K2 is also essential for blood clotting and may have other cardiovascular benefits. Natto is one of the richest food sources of vitamin K2, making it a unique and valuable addition to your diet for bone and heart health.</li>
<li><strong>Nattokinase Enzyme:</strong> Natto contains an enzyme called nattokinase, which has been shown to have potential benefits for cardiovascular health. Nattokinase is known for its fibrinolytic activity, meaning it can help break down blood clots and improve blood flow. This enzyme is being studied for its potential to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Incorporating natto into your diet may contribute to a healthier cardiovascular system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients and Equipment</h2>
<p>Alright, so you're convinced about the awesomeness of natto and ready to make your own? Great! Let's talk about what you'll need. The ingredient list is surprisingly short and sweet, which is one of the many things I love about this dish. But having the right equipment can make the process much smoother. Here’s the lowdown:</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soybeans:</strong> The star of the show! You'll want to use dried soybeans, specifically a variety that's known for making good natto. Smaller soybeans tend to work best, as they ferment more evenly. Look for organic, non-GMO soybeans if possible, to ensure the best quality and flavor. The type of soybeans you choose can significantly impact the final taste and texture of your natto. Experimenting with different varieties can lead to discovering your favorite natto style.</li>
<li><em><strong>Natto Starter (Bacillus subtilis):</strong></em> This is what makes the magic happen! You can find natto starter cultures online or at Asian grocery stores. It comes in a powdered form and contains the live bacteria necessary for fermentation. Using a high-quality starter culture is crucial for successful fermentation and the development of the characteristic natto flavor and texture. Make sure to follow the instructions on the package for the best results.</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> You'll need water for soaking the soybeans and for creating the right humidity during fermentation. Use filtered water if possible, to avoid any unwanted flavors or contaminants. The quality of the water can affect the fermentation process, so it's best to use the purest water you can find.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equipment:</h3>

<li><strong>Large Pot:</strong> For soaking and steaming the soybeans. Make sure it's big enough to hold the beans and plenty of water, as the soybeans will expand significantly during soaking. A heavy-bottomed pot is ideal for even heat distribution during steaming.</li>
<li><strong>Steamer Basket or Instant Pot:</strong> Steaming is the traditional method for cooking the soybeans, but an Instant Pot can also be used for convenience and speed. A steamer basket placed inside the pot allows the beans to cook without sitting in water, which helps to retain their flavor and nutrients. If using an Instant Pot, follow the manufacturer's instructions for steaming beans.</li>
<li><strong>Sterilized Containers:</strong> You'll need containers to ferment the natto in. Glass or food-grade plastic containers work well. Sterilizing the containers is essential to prevent the growth of unwanted bacteria that could interfere with the fermentation process. You can sterilize the containers by boiling them in water for 10 minutes or by running them through a dishwasher's sanitize cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Incubator or Warm Place:</strong> Natto needs a warm, humid environment to ferment properly. An incubator specifically designed for natto making is ideal, but you can also use a yogurt maker, a bread proofer, or even an oven with a pilot light. The key is to maintain a consistent temperature between 100°F (38°C) and 110°F (43°C) for the duration of the fermentation process. If you don't have a dedicated incubator, you can create a warm environment by placing the containers in a cooler with a bowl of hot water or wrapping them in a heating pad set to low.</li>
<li><strong>Thermometer:</strong> Monitoring the temperature is crucial for successful fermentation. A digital thermometer is the most accurate way to ensure the temperature stays within the optimal range. Consistent temperature control is vital for the Bacillus subtilis bacteria to thrive and properly ferment the soybeans.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step-by-Step Natto Recipe</h2>
<p>Okay, guys, now for the fun part – actually <em>making</em> the natto! Don't worry, it's not as complicated as it might seem. Just follow these steps, and you'll be enjoying homemade natto in no time. Here’s a detailed, step-by-step recipe to guide you through the process:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Soak the Soybeans</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rinse 1 cup of dried soybeans thoroughly under cold water to remove any debris or impurities. This step ensures that you start with clean beans, which is essential for the fermentation process.</li>
<li>Place the rinsed soybeans in a large pot and add enough water to cover them by at least 3 inches. Soybeans will absorb a significant amount of water and expand during soaking, so it's important to provide ample space for them to do so. Use filtered water for the best results.</li>
<li>Soak the soybeans for 12-24 hours at room temperature. Soaking allows the soybeans to rehydrate fully, which is crucial for even cooking and fermentation. Change the water once or twice during the soaking period to prevent the growth of unwanted bacteria. Soaked soybeans should be plump and easily split open with your fingernail.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Cook the Soybeans</h3>
<ul>
<li>After soaking, drain the soybeans and rinse them again with fresh water. This helps to remove any remaining impurities and prepares the beans for cooking.</li>
<li>There are two primary methods for cooking the soybeans: steaming and using an Instant Pot. Steaming is the traditional method and helps retain the beans' flavor and nutrients. An Instant Pot is a convenient and faster alternative.
<ul>
<li><strong>Steaming:</strong> Place the soaked soybeans in a steamer basket set over a pot of boiling water. Ensure that the water level is below the steamer basket to prevent the beans from sitting in the water. Steam the soybeans for 6-8 hours, or until they are very tender and easily mashed. Check the water level periodically and add more if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Instant Pot:</strong> Place the soaked soybeans in the Instant Pot and add enough water to cover them. Cook on high pressure for 20-25 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release. The exact cooking time may vary depending on your Instant Pot model and the freshness of the soybeans. The beans should be very tender and easily mashed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regardless of the cooking method, the soybeans are cooked when they are easily mashed between your fingers. Overcooked soybeans may become mushy, while undercooked soybeans will not ferment properly. Proper cooking is essential for achieving the desired texture and flavor of the natto.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Cool and Inoculate the Soybeans</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once the soybeans are cooked, drain them well and let them cool slightly until they are still warm but not too hot to handle. The ideal temperature for inoculation is around 110°F (43°C). Cooling the soybeans to this temperature ensures that the natto starter bacteria will thrive without being killed by excessive heat.</li>
<li>While the soybeans are cooling, prepare the natto starter culture. Follow the instructions on the package, as the preparation method may vary slightly depending on the brand. Typically, you will dissolve a small amount of natto starter powder in a small amount of warm water. This activates the bacteria and ensures they are evenly distributed throughout the soybeans.</li>
<li>Gently mix the natto starter solution with the cooked soybeans, ensuring that the bacteria are evenly distributed. This is a critical step for successful fermentation. Use a clean utensil to avoid introducing any unwanted bacteria into the mixture.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Ferment the Natto</h3>
<ul>
<li>Transfer the inoculated soybeans to sterilized containers. You can use glass or food-grade plastic containers. Spread the soybeans in a thin layer to ensure even fermentation. Avoid overcrowding the containers, as this can inhibit proper fermentation.</li>
<li>Cover the containers with a breathable material, such as cheesecloth or paper towels, and secure it with a rubber band or lid. This allows air to circulate while preventing contaminants from entering. Proper ventilation is crucial for the fermentation process.</li>
<li>Place the containers in an incubator or a warm place with a consistent temperature between 100°F (38°C) and 110°F (43°C). An incubator designed for natto making, a yogurt maker, or even an oven with a pilot light can be used. Maintaining a consistent temperature is essential for the Bacillus subtilis bacteria to thrive and properly ferment the soybeans.</li>
<li>Ferment the natto for 14-24 hours. The fermentation time can vary depending on the temperature and humidity. Check the natto after 14 hours for its characteristic aroma, stickiness, and stringiness. If it hasn't fully fermented, continue the fermentation for a few more hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5: Refrigerate and Age the Natto</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once the natto has fermented, transfer the containers to the refrigerator. Refrigeration slows down the fermentation process and allows the flavors to develop further.</li>
<li>Age the natto in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours, or up to a few days. Aging enhances the flavor and stickiness of the natto. Many natto enthusiasts believe that aged natto has a richer, more complex flavor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 6: Enjoy Your Homemade Natto!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your homemade natto is now ready to enjoy! Serve it chilled or at room temperature. Natto is traditionally served over rice and mixed with soy sauce, mustard, and chopped Japanese bunching onions. Experiment with different toppings and seasonings to find your favorite combination. Natto can also be used in a variety of dishes, such as sushi rolls, salads, and even pasta sauces.</li>
</ul>
