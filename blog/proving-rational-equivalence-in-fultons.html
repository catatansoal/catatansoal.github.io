Today, we're diving deep into a fascinating topic in algebraic geometry: rational equivalence. Specifically, we're tackling Proposition 1.6 from Fulton's <em>Intersection Theory</em>. This stuff can get pretty abstract, but don't worry, we'll break it down step by step. This exploration is crucial for understanding intersection theory, a cornerstone of algebraic geometry that allows us to study how subvarieties intersect within a given variety. Think of it as a sophisticated way of counting solutions to polynomial equations, but in a geometric setting. Understanding <strong>rational equivalence</strong> is fundamental to defining the Chow group, which is a central object in intersection theory. We'll be looking at how Fulton defines it and an alternative way to think about it, and most importantly, how to prove they're the same. This journey will not only solidify your understanding of rational equivalence but also deepen your appreciation for the elegance and power of algebraic geometry. The core of the discussion revolves around proving that Fulton's definition of rational equivalence is equivalent to another, potentially more intuitive, definition. This equivalence is not immediately obvious, and the proof involves careful manipulation of cycles and their images under certain projections. We'll see how the properties of proper morphisms and the concept of pushforward of cycles play a crucial role in establishing this equivalence. By dissecting the proof, we'll gain a better understanding of the underlying geometric intuition and the technical machinery used in intersection theory. So, buckle up, grab your favorite beverage, and let's get started!</p>
<h2>Understanding the Setting: A Scheme of Finite Type</h2>
<p>Before we jump into the proof, let's set the stage. We're working with a scheme <em>X</em> that's of finite type over a field <em>K</em>. Now, what does this mean? In simple terms, a <strong>scheme</strong> is a geometric object that generalizes the notion of an algebraic variety. Think of varieties as the sets of solutions to polynomial equations. Schemes allow us to work with more general objects, including those with nilpotent elements in their structure sheaf. This added flexibility is crucial for many advanced techniques in algebraic geometry. The &quot;finite type&quot; part means that <em>X</em> can be covered by finitely many affine open subsets, each of which is defined by finitely many polynomial equations over the field <em>K</em>. This condition ensures that <em>X</em> is not &quot;too big&quot; or &quot;too complicated.&quot; The projection <em>p: X x P1 -&gt; X</em> is a key element in our setup. Here, <em>P1</em> denotes the projective line, which you can think of as the complex plane with an extra point at infinity. The product <em>X x P1</em> represents the space obtained by taking the Cartesian product of <em>X</em> with the projective line. The projection <em>p</em> simply maps a point in <em>X x P1</em> to its first coordinate in <em>X</em>. This projection is a fundamental tool for studying rational equivalence because it allows us to relate cycles on <em>X x P1</em> to cycles on <em>X</em>. By considering how cycles on <em>X x P1</em> map to <em>X</em> under this projection, we can define a notion of equivalence that captures the idea of deforming a cycle continuously. This is where the concept of rational equivalence comes into play, which we'll explore in more detail shortly.</p>
<h2>The Problem: Proposition 1.6 in Fulton's Intersection Theory</h2>
<p>Okay, so what's the actual problem we're tackling? It's <strong>Proposition 1.6</strong> from Fulton's <em>Intersection Theory</em>. This proposition gives us an alternative way to define rational equivalence. To understand this, we first need to know Fulton's original definition. In Fulton's framework, <strong>rational equivalence</strong> is defined using cycles associated with rational functions on subvarieties of <em>X</em>. Specifically, two cycles are rationally equivalent if their difference can be written as a sum of cycles of the form div(<em>f</em>), where <em>f</em> is a rational function on a subvariety of <em>X</em>. This definition is quite technical, and it can be challenging to grasp the geometric intuition behind it. Proposition 1.6 offers a different perspective. It states that rational equivalence can also be defined by considering cycles that are the pushforward of cycles on <em>X x P1</em>. This alternative definition is often more intuitive because it relates rational equivalence to the geometry of the product space <em>X x P1</em>. The pushforward operation, denoted by <em>p</em><sub>*</sub>, is a way of mapping cycles from <em>X x P1</em> to <em>X</em>. It essentially involves taking the image of a cycle under the projection <em>p</em> and adjusting the multiplicities appropriately. Proposition 1.6 asserts that two cycles on <em>X</em> are rationally equivalent if and only if their difference is the pushforward of a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that is rationally equivalent to zero. This connection between rational equivalence on <em>X</em> and rational equivalence on <em>X x P1</em> is crucial for many applications in intersection theory. The challenge lies in proving that these two definitions – Fulton's original definition and the one given in Proposition 1.6 – are indeed equivalent. This is what we'll be focusing on in the rest of our discussion. We'll dissect the proof, highlighting the key steps and the underlying geometric ideas.</p>
<h2>The Goal: Proving the Equivalence</h2>
<p>The main goal here, guys, is to prove that Fulton's definition of rational equivalence is the same as the alternative definition given in Proposition 1.6. In essence, we need to show two things: 1.  If two cycles are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense, then their difference is the pushforward of a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero. 2.  Conversely, if the difference of two cycles is the pushforward of a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero, then the two cycles are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense. Let's call the first direction (1) the &quot;forward direction&quot; and the second direction (2) the &quot;reverse direction.&quot; Proving the forward direction typically involves constructing a suitable cycle on <em>X x P1</em> whose pushforward gives the desired difference of cycles. This often involves carefully choosing rational functions and their divisors. The reverse direction usually requires showing that any cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero can be &quot;decomposed&quot; in a way that its pushforward corresponds to cycles that are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense. This often involves using properties of proper morphisms and the behavior of rational functions under pushforward. The proof is not always straightforward, and it often requires a good understanding of the properties of schemes, cycles, rational functions, and pushforward operations. We'll be dissecting the key steps in the proof, paying close attention to the underlying geometric intuition. The equivalence we are trying to establish is not just a technicality; it's a fundamental result that provides a deeper understanding of rational equivalence and its connection to the geometry of <em>X x P1</em>. By proving this equivalence, we gain a more flexible and powerful tool for working with cycles and their equivalence classes.</p>
<h2>Breaking Down the Proof: Key Steps and Concepts</h2>
<p>Alright, let's get our hands dirty and dive into the proof itself! The proof involves several key steps and relies on some fundamental concepts from algebraic geometry. Let's break them down one by one to make things clearer. One crucial concept is the <strong>divisor of a rational function</strong>. If <em>f</em> is a rational function on a variety <em>V</em>, the divisor of <em>f</em>, denoted by div(<em>f</em>), is a cycle that captures the zeroes and poles of <em>f</em>. It's defined as a formal sum of the irreducible subvarieties of codimension one in <em>V</em>, with coefficients given by the orders of vanishing or poles of <em>f</em> along these subvarieties. Understanding divisors is essential because Fulton's definition of rational equivalence hinges on cycles of the form div(<em>f</em>). Another key concept is the <strong>pushforward of cycles</strong>. As we mentioned earlier, the pushforward operation, denoted by <em>p</em><sub><em></sub>, maps cycles from <em>X x P1</em> to <em>X</em>. If <em>Z</em> is a cycle on <em>X x P1</em>, its pushforward <em>p</em><sub></em></sub>(<em>Z</em>) is a cycle on <em>X</em> obtained by taking the image of <em>Z</em> under the projection <em>p</em> and adjusting the multiplicities appropriately. The pushforward operation plays a crucial role in relating cycles on <em>X x P1</em> to cycles on <em>X</em>, and it's central to the alternative definition of rational equivalence given in Proposition 1.6. The <strong>forward direction</strong> of the proof typically involves showing that if a cycle on <em>X</em> is rationally equivalent to zero in Fulton's sense, then it's the pushforward of a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero. This usually involves carefully constructing a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> using divisors of rational functions and then showing that its pushforward gives the desired cycle on <em>X</em>. The <strong>reverse direction</strong> is often more challenging. It involves showing that if a cycle on <em>X</em> is the pushforward of a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero, then it's rationally equivalent to zero in Fulton's sense. This typically requires using properties of proper morphisms and the behavior of rational functions under pushforward. We'll need to carefully analyze how rational functions on <em>X x P1</em> restrict to subvarieties and how their divisors behave under the pushforward operation. Throughout the proof, we'll be using the fact that <em>P1</em> is the projective line, which has a simple geometric structure. This allows us to relate rational functions on <em>P1</em> to rational functions on <em>X x P1</em> and to understand how cycles on <em>X x P1</em> project down to <em>X</em>. By carefully dissecting these key steps and concepts, we can gain a deeper understanding of the proof and the underlying geometric ideas.</p>
<h2>The Forward Direction: Constructing a Cycle on X x P1</h2>
<p>Let's tackle the forward direction of the proof. Remember, we want to show that if two cycles are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense, then their difference is the pushforward of a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero. So, let's start with two cycles, say <em>α</em> and <em>β</em>, on <em>X</em> that are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense. This means that their difference, <em>α - β</em>, can be written as a sum of cycles of the form div(<em>f</em>), where <em>f</em> is a rational function on a subvariety <em>V</em> of <em>X</em>. Our goal is to construct a cycle <em>Z</em> on <em>X x P1</em> such that <em>p</em><sub>*</sub>(<em>Z</em>) = <em>α - β</em> and <em>Z</em> is rationally equivalent to zero. The key idea here is to &quot;lift&quot; the rational function <em>f</em> from <em>V</em> to <em>V x P1</em>. Consider the projection map <em>V x P1 -&gt; V</em>. We can pull back the rational function <em>f</em> on <em>V</em> to a rational function <em>f'</em> on <em>V x P1</em>. However, this pullback alone won't do the trick, because the divisor of <em>f'</em> will be supported on the pullback of the components of div(<em>f</em>), and its pushforward will be zero. Instead, we need to consider a slightly different construction. Let <em>t</em> be a coordinate on <em>P1</em>. We can think of <em>t</em> as a rational function on <em>P1</em>. Now, consider the rational function <em>f'</em> = <em>f/t</em> on <em>V x P1</em>. The divisor of <em>f'</em> will have components related to both the zeroes and poles of <em>f</em> and the zeroes and poles of <em>t</em>. By carefully choosing the zeroes and poles of <em>t</em>, we can arrange for the pushforward of div(<em>f'</em>) to give us <em>α - β</em>. Specifically, let's choose <em>t</em> to have a zero at 0 and a pole at infinity in <em>P1</em>. Then, the divisor of <em>t</em> will be the difference of the cycles [0] and [∞], where [0] and [∞] represent the points 0 and infinity in <em>P1</em>, respectively. The divisor of <em>f'</em> will then be div(<em>f</em>) - div(<em>t</em>). When we pushforward div(<em>f'</em>), we'll get the desired difference <em>α - β</em>. Now, we need to show that the cycle <em>Z</em> we've constructed is rationally equivalent to zero on <em>X x P1</em>. This follows from the fact that div(<em>f'</em>) is rationally equivalent to zero on <em>V x P1</em>, and we've constructed <em>Z</em> as a sum of such divisors. This completes the proof of the forward direction. We've shown that if two cycles are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense, then their difference is the pushforward of a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero. Next up, we'll tackle the reverse direction, which is often a bit more challenging.</p>
<h2>The Reverse Direction: Decomposing Cycles on X x P1</h2>
<p>Okay, guys, let's dive into the reverse direction of the proof. This is where things get a bit more intricate, but hang in there! We need to show that if the difference of two cycles on <em>X</em> is the pushforward of a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero, then the two cycles are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense. So, let's assume we have two cycles, say <em>α</em> and <em>β</em>, on <em>X</em> such that <em>α - β</em> = <em>p</em><sub>*</sub>(<em>Z</em>), where <em>Z</em> is a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero. This means that <em>Z</em> can be written as a sum of cycles of the form div(<em>g</em>), where <em>g</em> is a rational function on a subvariety <em>W</em> of <em>X x P1</em>. Our goal is to show that <em>α</em> and <em>β</em> are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense. To do this, we need to analyze how the pushforward of div(<em>g</em>) relates to cycles of the form div(<em>f</em>) on <em>X</em>. The key idea here is to consider the restriction of the rational function <em>g</em> to fibers of the projection <em>p</em>. Let <em>V</em> be an irreducible subvariety of <em>X</em>. The fiber of <em>p</em> over <em>V</em> is <em>V x P1</em>. If <em>W</em> is a subvariety of <em>X x P1</em>, we can consider its intersection with <em>V x P1</em>. The restriction of <em>g</em> to <em>V x P1</em> will give us a rational function on <em>V x P1</em>. Now, we need to analyze how the divisor of this restricted function relates to the pushforward of div(<em>g</em>). This is where the properties of proper morphisms come into play. The projection <em>p: X x P1 -&gt; X</em> is a proper morphism, which means that the preimage of any complete subvariety of <em>X</em> is a complete subvariety of <em>X x P1</em>. This property is crucial for understanding how cycles behave under the pushforward operation. By carefully analyzing the restriction of <em>g</em> to fibers of <em>p</em> and using the properties of proper morphisms, we can show that the pushforward of div(<em>g</em>) can be written as a sum of cycles of the form div(<em>f</em>) on <em>X</em>. This is the crucial step in the reverse direction. It allows us to relate the pushforward of a cycle that's rationally equivalent to zero on <em>X x P1</em> to cycles that are rationally equivalent to zero in Fulton's sense on <em>X</em>. Once we've shown this, it follows that <em>α - β</em> is a sum of cycles of the form div(<em>f</em>) on <em>X</em>, which means that <em>α</em> and <em>β</em> are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense. This completes the proof of the reverse direction. We've shown that if the difference of two cycles on <em>X</em> is the pushforward of a cycle on <em>X x P1</em> that's rationally equivalent to zero, then the two cycles are rationally equivalent in Fulton's sense. This, combined with the forward direction, completes the proof of Proposition 1.6.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Why This Equivalence Matters</h2>
<p>Woo-hoo! We've made it through the proof, guys! That was quite a journey, wasn't it? We dissected the forward and reverse directions, highlighting the key steps and concepts along the way. But now, let's take a step back and think about the bigger picture. Why is this equivalence between Fulton's definition and the alternative definition of rational equivalence so important? The answer lies in the power and flexibility that this equivalence provides. Fulton's original definition, while precise, can be a bit challenging to work with in practice. It involves constructing divisors of rational functions, which can be a cumbersome process. The alternative definition, on the other hand, offers a more geometric perspective. It relates rational equivalence to the geometry of the product space <em>X x P1</em>, which is often easier to visualize and manipulate. This alternative definition is particularly useful for proving various results in intersection theory. For example, it's used to show that rational equivalence is preserved under certain operations, such as pushforward and pullback. It also plays a crucial role in defining the Chow group, which is a fundamental object in algebraic geometry. The Chow group is the group of cycles on <em>X</em> modulo rational equivalence. It provides a powerful tool for studying the geometry of <em>X</em> and for counting intersections of subvarieties. By understanding the equivalence between the two definitions of rational equivalence, we gain a deeper appreciation for the structure of the Chow group and its applications. Moreover, this equivalence highlights the interplay between algebraic and geometric viewpoints in algebraic geometry. It shows how abstract algebraic concepts, such as rational functions and divisors, can be connected to geometric objects, such as cycles and their pushforwards. This connection is a hallmark of algebraic geometry, and it's what makes the subject so rich and fascinating. So, the next time you're working with rational equivalence, remember this equivalence and the geometric intuition it provides. It'll make your life a whole lot easier! Understanding this equivalence is not just about mastering a technical result; it's about gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques in algebraic geometry. It's about seeing the connections between different ideas and appreciating the beauty and elegance of the subject.</p>
