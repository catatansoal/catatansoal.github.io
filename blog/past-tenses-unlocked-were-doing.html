Ever get tangled up in the tricky world of past tenses? It's a common head-scratcher, especially when we're trying to nail the perfect way to talk about something that happened in the past, relative to another point in the past. Today, we're going to dissect a fascinating example from an interview with Captain Sullenberger – you know, the hero of the &quot;Miracle on the Hudson&quot; – where he uses two slightly different phrases that can really change the nuance of what he's saying. We'll be looking at: &quot;I had said in interviews that I thought we were doing&quot; versus &quot;I said in interviews that I thought we'd been doing.&quot; Sounds complex? Don't worry, we'll break it down in a way that's super easy to grasp!</p>
<h2>Understanding the Basics: Past Simple and Past Perfect</h2>
<p>Before we dive into Sully's specific words, let's quickly refresh our memory on the two key players here: the <strong>past simple</strong> and the <strong>past perfect</strong>. Think of the <em>past simple</em> as your go-to for describing actions that are completed in the past. It's straightforward and tells us something <em>happened</em>. For example, &quot;I <em>watched</em> a movie last night.&quot; Simple, right? The <em>past perfect</em>, on the other hand, is like the time-traveling tense. It's used to show that one action in the past happened <em>before</em> another action in the past. We build it using &quot;had&quot; + the past participle of the verb. Imagine you're telling a story: &quot;I <em>had finished</em> my homework before my friends arrived.&quot; The finishing homework part happened first, before the friends showed up.</p>
<p>The <strong>past simple</strong>, often considered the backbone of past tense narration, plays a crucial role in conveying events that have concluded within a defined timeframe. This tense is straightforward, offering clarity and simplicity in describing actions or situations that have occurred and finished in the past. Using the past simple effectively anchors timelines in storytelling and conversation, creating a clear sequence of events for the audience. For instance, stating &quot;I <em>visited</em> Paris last summer&quot; immediately provides a sense of completion and establishes a specific past moment without leaving room for ambiguity. It directly communicates that the trip occurred, concluded, and is now part of one's personal history. This clear, concise nature makes the past simple essential for laying down the basic events of a narrative. Moreover, the past simple doesn't rely on the context of other past events to make sense, making it a versatile tool for discussing single, discrete occurrences. Whether recounting a recent experience or documenting historical happenings, the past simple delivers a definitive statement about a past event’s completion, making it an indispensable tool in our linguistic toolkit. Its ability to stand alone and provide clarity on completed actions is why it's so frequently used in everyday communication and formal writing alike, establishing it as a fundamental element of effective past tense narration.</p>
<p>Now, let’s turn our attention to the <strong>past perfect</strong>, a tense that adds depth and complexity to our storytelling by placing actions in a specific temporal order. Unlike the past simple, which merely states that something happened, the past perfect establishes a sequence, indicating that one action occurred before another. This tense is constructed by pairing the auxiliary verb &quot;had&quot; with the past participle of the main verb, effectively transporting listeners or readers back to an earlier point in the timeline. For instance, consider the sentence, &quot;By the time the guests arrived, we <em>had finished</em> decorating.&quot; Here, the past perfect &quot;had finished&quot; clearly shows that the decorating was completed before the guests' arrival, providing crucial context about the sequence of events. This kind of structuring helps prevent confusion and enriches the narrative by illustrating causal relationships or the progression of events. Furthermore, the past perfect is vital in complex narratives where multiple past events intersect, as it ensures clarity and maintains a logical flow. Whether it's a novel, a news report, or a casual conversation, the past perfect serves as a linguistic anchor, grounding the audience in a specific past moment from which subsequent events unfold. This functionality is particularly useful in creating suspense or revealing information gradually, enhancing the storytelling experience. Therefore, mastering the past perfect is essential for anyone looking to communicate nuanced timelines and intricate sequences of events, making it a powerful tool in the art of narration.</p>
<h2>Sully's Words: A Closer Look at the Grammaticality</h2>
<p>Okay, now let's get back to Sully. The journalist asks him if his perception of the events of that day has changed over the 15 years since the &quot;Miracle on the Hudson.&quot; Sully responds by saying yes, and then he elaborates, using the phrases we're here to explore. Let's break them down:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;I had said in interviews that I thought we were doing...&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this first version, Sully uses &quot;had said,&quot; which is the past perfect, and then &quot;thought we were doing,&quot; which is the past continuous. The use of the <em>past perfect</em> <strong>(&quot;had said&quot;)</strong> here indicates that the act of saying something in interviews happened before his current reflection on the events. He's reaching back to a time in the past when he gave those interviews. The phrase &quot;thought we were doing&quot; implies an ongoing action or state at that time in the past. So, at the time he gave the interviews, he believed they were in the process of doing something, or that something was happening. This construction paints a picture of his thoughts at a specific point in the past about an action that was ongoing then.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;I said in interviews that I thought we'd been doing...&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's examine the second option: &quot;I said in interviews that I thought we'd been doing...&quot; Here, Sully uses the <em>past simple</em> <strong>(&quot;said&quot;)</strong> and then &quot;thought we'd been doing,&quot; which is the past perfect continuous. This is where things get interesting! The past perfect continuous <strong>(&quot;we'd been doing&quot;)</strong> suggests an action that started in the past, continued for a period of time, and then finished before another point in the past. It adds a sense of duration and completion to the action. In this context, it implies that he thought, at the time of the interviews, that they had been engaged in a specific course of action for a while, and it had concluded before that moment.</p>
<p>To fully appreciate the nuance in Sully's choice of words, it's essential to dissect the grammatical structure and how it shapes the meaning. When Sully says, &quot;I had said in interviews that I thought we were doing...&quot;, he's employing a blend of past perfect and past continuous tenses. The past perfect &quot;had said&quot; anchors his statement in a specific past timeframe, indicating that his interviews occurred before his current reflection. The subsequent phrase, &quot;thought we were doing,&quot; uses the past continuous, suggesting an action that was ongoing at the time of those interviews. This implies a belief that, during the interviews, he perceived their actions as a continuous process or state. This construction paints a vivid picture of Sully's mindset at that earlier point, where he viewed their endeavors as something unfolding in real-time. This choice of tense emphasizes the dynamism and evolving nature of the situation as he understood it then. It’s as though he’s reaching back to recapture a moment when the action was still in progress, highlighting the fluidity and immediacy of his perceptions during that period.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the alternative, &quot;I said in interviews that I thought we'd been doing...,&quot; where the grammar takes us down a slightly different path. Here, Sully uses the past simple &quot;said&quot; followed by &quot;thought we'd been doing,&quot; which employs the past perfect continuous tense. This tense, a blend of perfect and continuous aspects, signifies an action that began in the past, persisted for a duration, and concluded before another past point of reference. In this context, it conveys that Sully, at the time of the interviews, believed they had been engaged in a particular course of action for a substantial period, and that this action had reached its completion before the interviews took place. The inclusion of the past perfect continuous adds a sense of both duration and finality to the action. It's as if Sully is reflecting on a period that had a clear beginning, middle, and end, all within a timeframe preceding the interviews. This framing suggests a more retrospective viewpoint, where the actions are seen as a cohesive, completed episode rather than an ongoing process. The subtle shift in tense thus alters the perception of the events, casting them as a defined chapter rather than a continuing narrative.</p>
<h2>Grammaticality in Context: What's the Difference?</h2>
<p>So, what's the practical difference between these two? It's all about the <strong>emphasis on completion and duration</strong>. The first option, &quot;thought we were doing,&quot; focuses more on the state of being in the process of doing something at that time. It's like a snapshot of his thoughts mid-action. The second option, &quot;thought we'd been doing,&quot; emphasizes that the action had been ongoing for a period and was completed before the interviews. It's more of a retrospective view, looking back at a finished process.</p>
<p>In essence, the subtle change in tense alters the perception of the events, shifting the focus from a state of ongoing activity to a completed process. To fully grasp this distinction, let’s delve deeper into how each grammatical choice shapes the narrative and affects the listener’s understanding. When Sully says, &quot;I had said in interviews that I thought we were doing...,&quot; the use of the past continuous subtly highlights the immediacy and dynamism of the situation as he perceived it at that time. It’s as though he's inviting the listener to share in his perspective from the past, capturing a moment when the actions were unfolding and the outcome was yet uncertain. This construction emphasizes the fluid nature of events and suggests that his understanding was still evolving. The focus is on the present moment within that past timeframe, where the process is ongoing and the trajectory still unfolding. It conveys a sense of being in the midst of action, with all the uncertainties and pressures that accompany such a state. This choice of words might resonate more strongly with those who appreciate the intricacies of decision-making under pressure, as it mirrors the real-time experience of navigating a complex situation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the phrase &quot;I said in interviews that I thought we'd been doing...&quot; adopts a more retrospective stance, inviting reflection on a process that has come to its conclusion. The past perfect continuous tense infuses a sense of duration and completion, signaling that the actions in question spanned a period of time and reached their resolution before the interviews took place. This framing presents a more cohesive and contained narrative, where the events are viewed as a defined episode in the past. The emphasis shifts from the immediacy of the action to the overall experience and its culmination. This perspective might appeal more to those who seek closure and clarity, as it offers a sense of order and finality. The focus is on the end result and the journey leading up to it, providing a comprehensive view of a completed endeavor. This subtle shift in tense can significantly alter the listener’s emotional and intellectual engagement with the narrative, underscoring the power of language to shape perceptions and convey nuanced meanings. By choosing the past perfect continuous, Sully frames the events as a well-defined chapter in his past, inviting a different kind of reflection and understanding.</p>
<h2>Which is &quot;Correct&quot;? Grammaticality and Context</h2>
<p>So, which one is &quot;correct&quot;? Well, both are grammatically sound! The better choice depends on the specific nuance Sully wants to convey. If he wants to emphasize the ongoing nature of the action at the time of the interviews, &quot;thought we were doing&quot; is the way to go. If he wants to highlight the duration and completion of the action before the interviews, &quot;thought we'd been doing&quot; is more fitting. It’s all about choosing the tense that best reflects his intended meaning and the specific shade of the past he wants to paint.</p>
<p>This grammatical nuance underscores a broader principle about language: the “correct” choice often hinges on context and intent, rather than strict adherence to rules. To fully grasp this concept, let's delve deeper into how context shapes linguistic choices and how speakers strategically employ language to convey specific shades of meaning. In the case of Sully's reflection, the seemingly subtle difference in tense—between “thought we were doing” and “thought we'd been doing”—carries significant weight. Each phrase frames the past events in a unique light, influencing the listener’s interpretation and emotional response. The selection of one over the other isn’t merely a matter of grammatical correctness but a deliberate act of shaping the narrative.</p>
<p>When we communicate, we’re not just relaying facts; we’re crafting stories and inviting our audience to share our perspective. This creative process demands a keen awareness of the tools at our disposal, including tense, aspect, and modality. Each linguistic element contributes to the overall tapestry of meaning, and a skilled speaker or writer wields these tools with precision and purpose. The context in which communication occurs—the audience, the topic, the speaker’s goals—plays a pivotal role in guiding these choices. For instance, in a formal setting, a speaker might opt for more precise and grammatically complex constructions to convey authority and credibility. Conversely, in a casual conversation, the same speaker might use simpler language and more colloquial expressions to foster connection and rapport. The same principle applies to the choice of tense. If Sully aimed to emphasize the ongoing, uncertain nature of the situation as he perceived it during the interviews, “thought we were doing” would be the more apt choice. This construction invites the listener to step into his shoes at that moment, experiencing the immediacy and pressure of the situation. However, if his goal was to provide a retrospective overview of a completed process, “thought we’d been doing” would be more fitting, offering a sense of closure and resolution. Ultimately, the effectiveness of communication lies not just in grammatical accuracy but in the artful alignment of language with context and intent. This underscores the dynamic, creative nature of language use, where speakers and writers are constantly making choices to shape their message and engage their audience.</p>
