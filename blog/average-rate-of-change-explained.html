title="Understanding Average Rate of Change The average rate of change of a function is a fundamental concept in calculus and is essential for understanding how a function&#39;s output changes with respect to its input. In this article, we&#39;ll dive deep into the average rate of change, focusing on a specific problem involving the function *g(x)*. We&#39;ll break down the concept, explore the given problem, and provide a comprehensive explanation to help you grasp the underlying principles. So, guys, let&#39;s get started and make math fun and accessible!## What is the Average Rate of Change? Before we tackle the problem at hand, let&#39;s clarify what the average rate of change actually means. Think of it as the average slope of a function between two points. It tells you how much the function&#39;s value changes, on average, for each unit change in the input. **Average rate of change** is a critical concept in mathematics, especially in calculus, as it lays the groundwork for understanding derivatives, which represent instantaneous rates of change. It&#39;s like finding the slope of a secant line that connects two points on the graph of a function. Imagine you are driving a car. The average speed during your trip is the total distance you traveled divided by the total time it took. This is an analogy to the average rate of change. If *g(x)* represents the position of an object at time *x*, then the average rate of change of *g(x)* over an interval is the average velocity of the object over that interval. Mathematically, the average rate of change of a function *f(x)* over the interval [*a, b*] is given by the formula:$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$This formula calculates the change in the function&#39;s output (*f(b) - f(a)*) divided by the change in the input (*b - a*). This gives us a single number that represents the average change in the function&#39;s value per unit change in *x* over the interval. For instance, consider a function that represents the population of a city over time. The average rate of change of the population over a decade would tell you how much the population grew, on average, each year during that decade. This concept is widely applicable in various fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and computer science. In physics, it can describe the average velocity or acceleration of an object. In economics, it can represent the average rate of inflation or the average growth rate of a company&#39;s revenue. In essence, the average rate of change provides a simplified way to understand the overall trend of a function&#39;s behavior over an interval, ignoring the finer details of its fluctuations within that interval. Now, let&#39;s put this understanding into practice by analyzing the problem presented.## Problem Statement: Unpacking the Given Information The problem states: &quot;The average rate of change of *g(x)* between *x* = 4 and *x* = 7 is 5/6. Which statement must be true?&quot; This problem gives us the average rate of change of a function *g(x)* over a specific interval and asks us to identify the correct equation that represents this information. **Understanding the problem** involves recognizing the key components: the function *g(x)*, the interval [*4, 7*], and the average rate of change, which is 5/6. The goal is to translate this information into a mathematical statement that accurately reflects the given conditions. The average rate of change is a concept that bridges the gap between algebra and calculus, so it&#39;s crucial to grasp it firmly. When we say &quot;average rate of change,&quot; we&#39;re talking about the slope of the secant line that connects the points on the graph of *g(x)* at *x* = 4 and *x* = 7. This is a constant value that represents the average change in *g(x)* per unit change in *x* over this interval. The interval [*4, 7*] defines the boundaries within which we are analyzing the function&#39;s behavior. The endpoints of this interval, 4 and 7, are the *x*-values at which we are evaluating the function *g(x)*. The given average rate of change, 5/6, is the numerical value that quantifies the average change in *g(x)* over the interval [*4, 7*]. It tells us that, on average, for every 1 unit increase in *x* within this interval, *g(x)* increases by 5/6 units. To solve this problem, we need to connect these pieces of information using the formula for the average rate of change. We need to express the relationship between *g(4)*, *g(7)*, and the interval endpoints in a way that equals the given average rate of change. The options provided likely present different formulations of this relationship, and our task is to identify the one that correctly applies the average rate of change formula. Now, let&#39;s move on to applying the average rate of change formula to the specific details of this problem.## Applying the Average Rate of Change Formula To solve this, we&#39;ll use the formula for the average rate of change that we discussed earlier. **Applying the formula** is the crucial step in translating the problem&#39;s information into a concrete mathematical statement. We know that the average rate of change of a function *g(x)* over the interval [*a, b*] is given by:$\frac{g(b) - g(a)}{b - a}$In our case, *a* = 4, *b* = 7, and the average rate of change is 5/6. So, we can substitute these values into the formula:$\frac{g(7) - g(4)}{7 - 4} = \frac{5}{6}$This equation is the key to identifying the correct statement. It directly represents the average rate of change of *g(x)* between *x* = 4 and *x* = 7. The numerator, *g(7) - g(4)*, represents the change in the function&#39;s value over the interval, while the denominator, 7 - 4, represents the change in *x* over the same interval. The entire fraction represents the ratio of these changes, which is the average rate of change. Now, let&#39;s simplify the denominator:$\frac{g(7) - g(4)}{3} = \frac{5}{6}$This simplified equation is another way to express the given information. It highlights that the change in *g(x)* over the interval, *g(7) - g(4)*, is related to the average rate of change (5/6) and the length of the interval (3). To fully understand the implications of this equation, we can rearrange it to isolate *g(7) - g(4)*:$g(7) - g(4) = \frac{5}{6} \times 3$$g(7) - g(4) = \frac{5}{2}$This final equation tells us the exact change in the function&#39;s value between *x* = 4 and *x* = 7. It&#39;s a direct consequence of the given average rate of change and the interval length. Now that we&#39;ve applied the formula and derived these equations, we can compare them to the given options and identify the one that must be true. This step-by-step approach ensures that we understand the mathematical principles involved and can confidently select the correct answer.## Analyzing the Options: Which Statement is Correct? Now, let&#39;s examine the options provided and see which one matches our derived equation. **Analyzing the options** is the final step in solving the problem. It requires us to compare each statement to the mathematical relationships we&#39;ve established and determine which one accurately reflects the given information. Here are the options:A. *g(7) - g(4) = 5/6*B. *(g(7) - g(4))/(7 - 4) = 5/6*C. *(7 - 4)/(g(7) - g(4)) = 5/6*D. *g(7)/g(4) = 5/6*Let&#39;s go through each option:A. *g(7) - g(4) = 5/6*This option states that the change in *g(x)* between *x* = 4 and *x* = 7 is equal to 5/6. However, we derived that *g(7) - g(4) = 5/2*, so this option is incorrect. It overlooks the interval length and only considers the average rate of change.B. *(g(7) - g(4))/(7 - 4) = 5/6*This option is exactly the average rate of change formula applied to the given problem. We derived this equation earlier, so this option must be true. It correctly represents the relationship between the change in *g(x)*, the change in *x*, and the average rate of change.C. *(7 - 4)/(g(7) - g(4)) = 5/6*This option is the reciprocal of the average rate of change. It represents the change in *x* divided by the change in *g(x)*, which is not what we&#39;re looking for. So, this option is incorrect.D. *g(7)/g(4) = 5/6*This option represents the ratio of the function&#39;s values at *x* = 7 and *x* = 4. It does not represent the average rate of change, which is concerned with the difference in the function&#39;s values, not their ratio. So, this option is also incorrect.Therefore, the correct statement is option B:$\frac{g(7) - g(4)}{7 - 4} = \frac{5}{6}$This option directly applies the average rate of change formula and accurately reflects the given information. By carefully analyzing each option and comparing it to our derived equation, we can confidently identify the correct answer.## Conclusion: Mastering Average Rate of Change In this article, we&#39;ve explored the concept of average rate of change and applied it to a specific problem. We&#39;ve seen how the average rate of change represents the average slope of a function between two points and how it can be calculated using the formula:$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$**Mastering the average rate of change** is essential for building a strong foundation in calculus and related fields. It provides a fundamental understanding of how functions change over intervals, which is a key concept in many areas of mathematics and science. By understanding the average rate of change, you can analyze the behavior of functions, make predictions about their future values, and solve a wide range of problems. We walked through the steps of understanding the problem, applying the formula, and analyzing the options to arrive at the correct answer. Remember, the average rate of change is the slope of the secant line connecting two points on the function&#39;s graph. It gives you a sense of the function&#39;s overall trend over an interval. It&#39;s also a stepping stone to understanding the concept of the derivative, which is the instantaneous rate of change at a single point. The derivative is the slope of the tangent line at that point and provides a much more detailed picture of how the function is changing. So, guys, keep practicing with different problems and scenarios to solidify your understanding. With a solid grasp of the average rate of change, you&#39;ll be well-equipped to tackle more advanced concepts in calculus and beyond. Remember, math is like a puzzle – each piece fits together to create a bigger picture. The average rate of change is one of those essential pieces that helps you see the whole picture more clearly. Happy learning, and keep exploring the fascinating world of mathematics!" width="300" height="200"/>
