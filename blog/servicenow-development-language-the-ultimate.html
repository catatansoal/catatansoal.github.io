<p>ServiceNow, a leading cloud-based platform, empowers organizations to streamline their IT service management (ITSM) and automate various business processes. At the heart of ServiceNow's robust functionality lies its development language, a crucial component for customizing and extending the platform's capabilities. Understanding the <strong>ServiceNow development language</strong> is paramount for developers and administrators aiming to tailor the platform to meet specific organizational needs. This comprehensive guide delves into the intricacies of the ServiceNow development language, exploring its core components, functionalities, and best practices for effective utilization.</p>

<p>At its core, the <strong>ServiceNow development language</strong> is a proprietary scripting language built upon JavaScript. This makes it accessible to developers familiar with web development technologies, allowing them to leverage their existing skills within the ServiceNow environment. ServiceNow's scripting capabilities extend across both the client-side and server-side, enabling developers to build dynamic user interfaces, automate complex workflows, and integrate with external systems. The platform provides a rich set of APIs and tools that facilitate the creation of custom applications and functionalities tailored to specific business requirements. This flexibility allows organizations to adapt ServiceNow to their unique processes and workflows, maximizing the platform's value and impact.</p>

<p>ServiceNow's development language comprises several key components that developers utilize to build and customize applications. These components work together to provide a comprehensive scripting environment. Grasping each component's role is crucial for effective ServiceNow development.</p>
<h2>Client-Side Scripting</h2>
<p>Client-side scripting in ServiceNow involves scripts that execute within the user's web browser. These scripts primarily focus on enhancing the user interface and improving the user experience. <strong>Client-side scripts</strong> respond to user interactions, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and perform validations before data is sent to the server. This reduces server load and provides immediate feedback to the user. Common types of client-side scripts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client Scripts:</strong> These scripts execute when a record is displayed, modified, or submitted. They can be used to validate data, set field values, and control the behavior of UI elements.</li>
<li><strong>UI Policies:</strong> UI Policies define rules that control the visibility, mandatory status, and read-only state of fields on a form. They provide a declarative way to manage UI behavior without writing complex scripts.</li>
<li><strong>UI Actions:</strong> UI Actions add buttons, links, and context menu items to forms and lists. They allow users to perform specific actions, such as approving a request or creating a related record.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding Client Scripts</h3>
<p>Client Scripts are pivotal in creating a dynamic and responsive user interface within ServiceNow. They operate directly within the user's browser, enabling immediate feedback and interaction without constant server communication. This not only enhances the user experience but also reduces the load on the ServiceNow server. For instance, imagine a scenario where a user is filling out a form. A Client Script can be implemented to instantly validate the input in a specific field, such as an email address or phone number, and provide an error message if the input doesn't match the required format. This immediate validation prevents the user from submitting incorrect data and avoids unnecessary server-side processing. Another common use case for Client Scripts is dynamically updating form fields based on the values entered in other fields. If a user selects a particular category from a dropdown menu, a Client Script can automatically populate related sub-categories in another field, making the form more intuitive and efficient to use. Furthermore, Client Scripts can control the visibility of form sections or specific fields based on user roles or other criteria. This ensures that users only see the information relevant to them, improving security and streamlining the user interface. By leveraging the power of Client Scripts, developers can create highly interactive and user-friendly forms within ServiceNow, significantly enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
<h3>Exploring UI Policies</h3>
<p>UI Policies in ServiceNow offer a declarative approach to managing the behavior and appearance of forms, providing a powerful alternative to writing complex Client Scripts for many common UI customization tasks. Think of UI Policies as a set of rules that dictate how fields on a form should behave based on certain conditions. These conditions can include the values of other fields, the user's role, or even the current time. One of the primary advantages of UI Policies is their simplicity and ease of use. Instead of writing JavaScript code, developers can define UI Policies through a user-friendly interface, specifying the conditions and the actions to be taken when those conditions are met. For example, a UI Policy can be configured to make a field mandatory if another field contains a specific value. This is particularly useful for ensuring that essential information is captured when certain conditions apply. UI Policies can also control the visibility of fields, showing or hiding them based on user roles or other criteria. This helps to streamline the user interface, presenting only the relevant information to each user. Additionally, UI Policies can set fields to read-only, preventing users from modifying them under specific circumstances. This is important for protecting sensitive data or ensuring data integrity. By using UI Policies, developers can create dynamic and adaptive forms that respond intelligently to user input and context, without the need for extensive scripting. This not only simplifies the development process but also makes it easier to maintain and update form behavior as requirements evolve. The declarative nature of UI Policies promotes consistency and reduces the risk of errors, making them a valuable tool for ServiceNow developers.</p>
<h3>Delving into UI Actions</h3>
<p>UI Actions in ServiceNow provide a mechanism for adding custom buttons, links, and context menu items to forms and lists, allowing users to perform specific actions directly from the user interface. These actions can range from simple operations, such as submitting a request or approving a change, to more complex processes that involve executing scripts or integrating with external systems. Imagine a scenario where a user is viewing an incident record. A UI Action could be added to the form that allows the user to escalate the incident to a higher priority level with a single click. This eliminates the need for the user to manually update the priority field and save the record, streamlining the escalation process. Another common use case for UI Actions is to create related records. For example, a UI Action on a problem record could allow users to quickly create a related incident record, linking the problem to the specific incidents it is causing. This improves the efficiency of problem management and helps to ensure that all related issues are tracked together. UI Actions can also be used to trigger workflows or scripts that automate complex processes. For instance, a UI Action could be added to a change request form that initiates a series of approvals and tasks based on the change's risk level and impact. This helps to ensure that changes are implemented in a controlled and consistent manner. Furthermore, UI Actions can be customized to appear only for specific users or roles, ensuring that users only have access to the actions that are relevant to them. This enhances security and helps to prevent accidental or unauthorized actions. By providing a flexible way to extend the user interface and automate processes, UI Actions are a powerful tool for ServiceNow developers, enabling them to tailor the platform to meet the specific needs of their organization.</p>
<h2>Server-Side Scripting</h2>
<p>Server-side scripting in ServiceNow involves scripts that execute on the ServiceNow server. These scripts handle data processing, workflow automation, and integrations with external systems. <strong>Server-side scripts</strong> are crucial for implementing business logic and ensuring data integrity. Common types of server-side scripts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Rules:</strong> Business Rules are scripts that run when records are displayed, inserted, updated, or deleted. They can be used to enforce business logic, validate data, and trigger events.</li>
<li><strong>Script Includes:</strong> Script Includes are reusable scripts that define functions and classes. They promote code reuse and modularity, making it easier to maintain and update scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Workflows:</strong> Workflows automate business processes by defining a sequence of activities and approvals. They use scripts to manage transitions, trigger events, and update records.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding Business Rules</h3>
<p>Business Rules are the backbone of server-side scripting in ServiceNow, providing a powerful mechanism for automating business processes and enforcing data integrity. These scripts execute on the ServiceNow server in response to database operations, such as inserting, updating, deleting, or displaying records. Think of Business Rules as automated guardians of your data, ensuring that it remains consistent and accurate. One of the primary functions of Business Rules is to enforce business logic. For example, a Business Rule could be configured to automatically calculate the due date of a task based on its priority and the assigned service level agreement (SLA). This eliminates the need for manual calculations and ensures that tasks are completed within the agreed-upon timeframes. Another common use case for Business Rules is data validation. A Business Rule can be used to check the validity of data entered by users, such as ensuring that a required field is not left blank or that a date falls within a valid range. This helps to prevent data entry errors and ensures the quality of your data. Business Rules can also be used to trigger events, such as sending email notifications when a record is updated or creating related records automatically. For instance, when a new incident is created, a Business Rule could automatically create a corresponding task for the appropriate support team. Furthermore, Business Rules can be configured to run before or after database operations, allowing for fine-grained control over the timing of script execution. This is important for ensuring that scripts are executed in the correct order and that data is updated consistently. By leveraging the power of Business Rules, developers can automate a wide range of business processes and ensure the integrity of their data in ServiceNow.</p>
<h3>Exploring Script Includes</h3>
<p>Script Includes in ServiceNow are reusable blocks of server-side code that encapsulate functions and classes, promoting modularity and code reuse. Think of Script Includes as libraries of pre-written code that can be called from other scripts, such as Business Rules, Workflows, and other Script Includes. This approach significantly reduces code duplication and makes it easier to maintain and update your ServiceNow instance. One of the key benefits of Script Includes is their ability to promote code reuse. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, developers can define a function or class in a Script Include and then call it from any other script that needs it. This not only saves time and effort but also reduces the risk of errors. For example, a Script Include could contain a function that calculates the time remaining until a task is due based on its SLA. This function can then be called from Business Rules, Workflows, or other Script Includes that need to perform this calculation. Script Includes also improve code organization and readability. By breaking down complex logic into smaller, reusable modules, developers can create scripts that are easier to understand and maintain. This is particularly important in large ServiceNow instances with many custom scripts. Furthermore, Script Includes can be used to encapsulate complex business logic, making it easier to update and modify the logic without affecting other parts of the system. If a change is needed to a particular function, it can be made in the Script Include, and all scripts that call that function will automatically use the updated version. This significantly reduces the effort required to maintain and update your ServiceNow instance. By providing a mechanism for code reuse and modularity, Script Includes are an essential tool for ServiceNow developers, helping them to build robust and maintainable applications.</p>
<h3>Delving into Workflows</h3>
<p>Workflows in ServiceNow are a powerful tool for automating business processes, providing a visual and intuitive way to define a sequence of activities and approvals. Think of Workflows as digital blueprints for your business processes, guiding tasks and information through a predefined path. They use a graphical interface to represent the different stages of a process, making it easy to understand and manage even complex workflows. One of the primary benefits of Workflows is their ability to automate repetitive tasks. For example, a Workflow could be created to automate the process of onboarding a new employee, including tasks such as creating user accounts, assigning roles, and ordering equipment. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and ensures that the process is followed consistently. Workflows can also manage approvals, routing tasks to the appropriate users for review and approval. For instance, a Workflow could be used to automate the approval process for change requests, ensuring that changes are reviewed and approved by the relevant stakeholders before they are implemented. This helps to reduce risk and improve the quality of changes. In addition to automating tasks and approvals, Workflows can also trigger events, such as sending email notifications or updating records in ServiceNow. For example, a Workflow could be configured to send an email notification to the assigned user when a new task is created or to update the status of an incident as it progresses through the resolution process. Workflows are highly customizable and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of any organization. They support a wide range of activities, including script execution, data manipulation, and integration with external systems. This makes them a versatile tool for automating a wide range of business processes. By providing a visual and intuitive way to define and automate business processes, Workflows are an essential tool for ServiceNow administrators and developers, helping them to streamline operations and improve efficiency.</p>
<h2>Glide API</h2>
<p>The Glide API is a set of JavaScript classes and methods that provide access to ServiceNow functionality. It allows developers to interact with the ServiceNow platform, query data, update records, and perform various operations. The <strong>Glide API</strong> is the foundation for most ServiceNow scripting, providing the tools needed to manipulate data and automate processes. The Glide API is extensive, covering various aspects of the ServiceNow platform. Some key areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GlideRecord:</strong> Used for querying and manipulating records in ServiceNow tables.</li>
<li><strong>GlideSystem:</strong> Provides access to system-level information and functions, such as the current user and date.</li>
<li><strong>GlideDateTime:</strong> Used for working with dates and times.</li>
<li><strong>GlideAggregate:</strong> Used for performing aggregate queries on ServiceNow tables.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deep Dive into GlideRecord</h3>
<p>GlideRecord is arguably the most fundamental and frequently used class within the ServiceNow Glide API. It serves as the primary interface for interacting with the ServiceNow database, allowing developers to query, retrieve, create, update, and delete records within tables. Imagine GlideRecord as your key to unlocking and manipulating data stored within ServiceNow. Understanding its methods and capabilities is essential for any ServiceNow developer. At its core, GlideRecord provides a powerful and flexible way to search for records based on specific criteria. You can use it to retrieve a single record by its unique identifier (sys_id) or to query for multiple records that match certain conditions. For instance, you could use GlideRecord to find all open incidents assigned to a particular user or to retrieve all configuration items of a specific type. Once you've retrieved a record, GlideRecord allows you to access its fields and their values. You can easily read the value of any field, such as the incident description, priority, or assigned to user. Similarly, you can update the values of fields, modifying the record to reflect changes in status, assignment, or other attributes. GlideRecord also provides methods for creating new records and deleting existing ones. This allows you to automate the creation of records based on specific events or conditions and to remove records that are no longer needed. Furthermore, GlideRecord supports a variety of methods for iterating through query results, allowing you to process multiple records efficiently. You can loop through the results of a query, performing actions on each record, such as updating its status or sending an email notification. The flexibility and power of GlideRecord make it an indispensable tool for ServiceNow developers, enabling them to automate a wide range of data-related tasks and processes.</p>
<h3>Exploring GlideSystem</h3>
<p>GlideSystem (gs) is another crucial class within the ServiceNow Glide API, providing access to a wealth of system-level information and functions. Think of GlideSystem as your window into the inner workings of the ServiceNow platform, allowing you to access details about the current user, session, system settings, and more. This class is often used to perform tasks that are not directly related to data manipulation but are essential for creating dynamic and context-aware applications. One of the most common uses of GlideSystem is to retrieve information about the current user. You can use it to get the user's name, user ID, roles, and other attributes. This is particularly useful for tailoring the user interface or application behavior based on the user's identity and permissions. For example, you could use GlideSystem to display a personalized welcome message to the user or to restrict access to certain features based on their role. GlideSystem also provides access to system-level settings and properties. You can use it to retrieve the current date and time, the instance name, and other system-wide configurations. This is useful for creating scripts that adapt to different environments or that need to perform time-sensitive operations. In addition to retrieving information, GlideSystem also provides functions for performing various system-level tasks. You can use it to log messages, send email notifications, generate events, and more. For instance, you could use GlideSystem to log an error message when an exception occurs or to send an email notification to the assigned user when a task is created. The versatility of GlideSystem makes it an essential tool for ServiceNow developers, enabling them to create applications that are not only functional but also context-aware and well-integrated with the platform.</p>
<h3>Understanding GlideDateTime</h3>
<p>GlideDateTime in ServiceNow is a powerful class designed for handling date and time values with precision and flexibility. Unlike standard JavaScript Date objects, GlideDateTime provides specific methods for working with ServiceNow's date and time formats, time zones, and durations. This makes it an indispensable tool for developers who need to perform date and time calculations, comparisons, and formatting within the platform. Think of GlideDateTime as your go-to class for all things related to dates and times in ServiceNow. One of the primary benefits of GlideDateTime is its ability to handle ServiceNow's specific date and time formats. ServiceNow stores dates and times in a particular format, and GlideDateTime ensures that you can work with these values consistently and accurately. You can use it to create GlideDateTime objects from strings, from existing date and time values, or from the current date and time. Once you have a GlideDateTime object, you can perform a variety of operations on it. You can add or subtract days, hours, minutes, or seconds. You can compare two GlideDateTime objects to determine which one is earlier or later. You can also format the date and time values in various ways, such as displaying them in a specific format or converting them to a different time zone. GlideDateTime also provides methods for working with durations. You can calculate the duration between two GlideDateTime objects or add a duration to a GlideDateTime object. This is particularly useful for calculating SLAs, task due dates, and other time-sensitive metrics. The precision and flexibility of GlideDateTime make it an essential tool for ServiceNow developers, enabling them to handle date and time values with confidence and accuracy.</p>
<h3>Exploring GlideAggregate</h3>
<p>GlideAggregate in ServiceNow is a specialized class within the Glide API designed for performing aggregate queries on ServiceNow tables. Think of GlideAggregate as your tool for summarizing and analyzing large datasets within ServiceNow. It allows you to calculate aggregate values, such as sums, averages, minimums, maximums, and counts, based on specific criteria. This is particularly useful for generating reports, dashboards, and other analytical tools. Unlike GlideRecord, which retrieves individual records, GlideAggregate focuses on summarizing data across multiple records. It allows you to group records based on one or more fields and then calculate aggregate values for each group. For example, you could use GlideAggregate to calculate the average resolution time for incidents grouped by assignment group or to count the number of open tasks assigned to each user. The key to using GlideAggregate is to specify the aggregate functions you want to calculate and the fields you want to group by. You can calculate multiple aggregate values in a single query, such as calculating both the sum and average of a field. You can also group records by multiple fields, creating more granular summaries of your data. Once you've defined your aggregate query, GlideAggregate executes it against the ServiceNow database and returns the results in a structured format. You can then iterate through the results, accessing the aggregate values and the corresponding group values. The ability to perform aggregate queries efficiently makes GlideAggregate an invaluable tool for ServiceNow developers who need to analyze data and generate reports.</p>

<p>Effective ServiceNow development requires adhering to best practices to ensure code quality, maintainability, and performance. These practices help developers write efficient and robust scripts that contribute to a stable and scalable ServiceNow instance.</p>
<h2>Code Reusability</h2>
<p>One of the cornerstones of efficient software development, and certainly crucial in <strong>ServiceNow development</strong>, is code reusability. Imagine building a house and having to create each brick from scratch every time you needed one. It would be incredibly time-consuming and inefficient, right? The same principle applies to coding. Instead of writing the same code snippets repeatedly, code reusability encourages developers to create modular, reusable components that can be used across multiple scripts and applications. This approach significantly reduces development time, minimizes errors, and makes code easier to maintain and update. In ServiceNow, the primary mechanism for achieving code reusability is through Script Includes. Script Includes allow you to define functions and classes that can be called from other scripts, such as Business Rules, Workflows, and Client Scripts. By encapsulating common logic within Script Includes, you can avoid code duplication and ensure consistency across your ServiceNow instance. For example, let's say you have a function that calculates the time remaining until a task is due based on its SLA. Instead of writing this function in every script that needs it, you can define it in a Script Include and then call it from those scripts. This not only saves you time but also makes it easier to update the function in the future. If you need to change the logic, you only need to modify it in one place, the Script Include, and all scripts that call it will automatically use the updated version. Code reusability also promotes modularity, which makes your code easier to understand and maintain. By breaking down complex logic into smaller, reusable modules, you can create scripts that are more focused and easier to debug. This is particularly important in large ServiceNow instances with many custom scripts. By embracing code reusability, you can significantly improve the efficiency and maintainability of your ServiceNow development efforts.</p>
<h2>Proper Error Handling</h2>
<p><strong>Proper error handling</strong> is an essential aspect of robust <strong>ServiceNow development</strong>, acting as a safety net for your scripts and ensuring that unexpected issues don't derail your processes. Think of error handling as the system you put in place to catch mistakes and prevent them from causing further problems. Without it, your scripts might crash, data could be corrupted, or users could encounter frustrating errors. Effective error handling involves anticipating potential problems and implementing mechanisms to detect, log, and recover from them. One of the key techniques for error handling in ServiceNow is using try-catch blocks. A try-catch block allows you to wrap a section of code that might throw an error in a try block. If an error occurs within the try block, the code in the catch block is executed. This allows you to handle the error gracefully, such as logging the error message, sending a notification, or taking corrective action. For example, imagine you have a script that updates a record in ServiceNow. If the script encounters an error, such as the record not existing or the user not having permission to update it, the try-catch block can catch the error and prevent the script from crashing. The catch block can then log the error message to the system log, so you can investigate the issue later. Proper error handling also involves logging errors effectively. When an error occurs, it's important to log as much information as possible, such as the error message, the script name, the line number, and the user who triggered the script. This information can be invaluable for debugging and troubleshooting issues. ServiceNow provides several mechanisms for logging errors, such as the gs.log() method and the System Log application. By implementing proper error handling, you can create more robust and reliable ServiceNow applications, reducing the risk of unexpected issues and ensuring a smoother user experience.</p>
<h2>Efficient Querying</h2>
<p><strong>Efficient querying</strong> is paramount in <strong>ServiceNow development</strong> to maintain the performance and responsiveness of your instance. Imagine searching for a specific book in a library that has no cataloging system – it would take an incredibly long time, right? Similarly, inefficient queries in ServiceNow can bog down your system, slowing down operations and frustrating users. Efficient querying involves writing queries that retrieve only the necessary data, minimizing the load on the database and improving the overall performance of your ServiceNow instance. One of the key principles of efficient querying is to use specific filters. Instead of retrieving all records from a table and then filtering them in your script, use the where clause in your GlideRecord query to specify the exact criteria you're looking for. For example, if you only need to retrieve incidents that are assigned to a particular user and are in the Open state, you should include these conditions in your query. Another important technique for efficient querying is to use indexes. Indexes are special data structures that speed up the process of searching for records based on specific fields. ServiceNow automatically creates indexes on certain fields, such as the sys_id field, but you can also create custom indexes on other fields that you frequently use in your queries. However, be cautious about creating too many indexes, as they can slow down the process of inserting and updating records. Efficient querying also involves limiting the number of fields you retrieve. If you only need a few fields from a record, you should use the query method addQuery() to specify those fields. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the database to your script, improving performance. Furthermore, you should avoid querying large tables unnecessarily. If you can retrieve the data you need from a smaller table or from a cached source, you should do so. By following these best practices, you can write queries that are both efficient and effective, ensuring that your ServiceNow instance performs optimally.</p>
<h2>Avoid Global Scope</h2>
<p>In <strong>ServiceNow development</strong>, <strong>avoiding the global scope</strong> is a crucial best practice for maintaining code quality, preventing naming conflicts, and ensuring the long-term stability of your instance. Think of the global scope as a shared workspace where all your scripts and variables reside. While it might seem convenient to declare variables and functions in the global scope, it can lead to a number of problems, especially in large ServiceNow instances with many custom scripts. One of the primary issues with using the global scope is the risk of naming conflicts. If two scripts declare variables or functions with the same name in the global scope, it can lead to unexpected behavior and errors. For example, if one script defines a function called calculateTotal() and another script defines a function with the same name, the second function will overwrite the first one, potentially breaking the first script. Another problem with the global scope is that it makes your code harder to understand and maintain. When variables and functions are declared in the global scope, it's difficult to track where they are being used and how they are being modified. This can make it challenging to debug issues and update your code in the future. To avoid these problems, it's essential to encapsulate your code within local scopes. In ServiceNow, you can use Script Includes to define functions and classes within a specific scope. This ensures that your code is isolated from other scripts and reduces the risk of naming conflicts. You can also use immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs) to create local scopes within your scripts. An IIFE is a function that is defined and executed immediately, creating a local scope for the code within it. By avoiding the global scope, you can create more modular, maintainable, and robust ServiceNow applications, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring the long-term stability of your instance.</p>
<h2>Comments and Documentation</h2>
<p><strong>Comments and documentation</strong> are indispensable for effective <strong>ServiceNow development</strong>, acting as a roadmap for understanding and maintaining your code. Imagine receiving a complex piece of machinery without any instructions – it would be incredibly difficult to figure out how it works and how to fix it if something goes wrong, right? Similarly, undocumented code can be a nightmare to work with, especially when you or another developer needs to revisit it months or years later. Comments are short, explanatory notes that you embed directly within your code. They serve as inline documentation, clarifying the purpose of specific code sections, explaining complex logic, or providing context for decisions you made. Think of comments as breadcrumbs that guide you through your code, making it easier to follow and understand. Effective comments should be concise, clear, and relevant. They should explain the why behind your code, not just the what. For example, instead of just saying &quot;// Set the priority to High&quot;, you could say &quot;// Set the priority to High because this is a critical issue&quot;. Documentation, on the other hand, is more comprehensive and provides a higher-level overview of your code. It can include things like descriptions of functions and classes, explanations of algorithms, and instructions for using your code. Think of documentation as a user manual for your code, providing all the information someone needs to understand how it works and how to use it. In ServiceNow, you can use JSDoc-style comments to generate documentation automatically. JSDoc is a markup language that allows you to embed structured comments within your code. Tools like JSDoc can then parse these comments and generate HTML documentation. By consistently adding comments and documentation to your code, you can make it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. This not only benefits you but also anyone else who might need to work with your code in the future.</p>

<p>ServiceNow's development language, based on JavaScript, provides a versatile platform for customizing and extending the platform's capabilities. By understanding the key components, such as client-side and server-side scripting, the Glide API, and best practices, developers can effectively tailor ServiceNow to meet specific organizational needs. Adhering to best practices, such as code reusability, proper error handling, and efficient querying, ensures the creation of robust and maintainable ServiceNow applications. With a solid grasp of the ServiceNow development language, organizations can leverage the platform to automate processes, improve efficiency, and drive digital transformation.</p>
