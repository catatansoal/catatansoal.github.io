Initially, ServiceNow carved its niche as an ITSM tool, streamlining and automating IT processes.

This foundation in ITSM allowed organizations to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance service delivery. However, ServiceNow's vision extended beyond just IT. The platform's architecture, built on a robust workflow engine and a common data model, made it highly adaptable to other areas of the business. Today, ServiceNow offers solutions for HR, customer service, security operations, and even custom application development.
