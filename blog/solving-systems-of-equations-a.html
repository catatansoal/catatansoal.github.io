Today, we're diving into the world of <strong>solving systems of equations</strong>. It might sound intimidating, but trust me, it's like a puzzle, and we're going to crack it together. We've got a specific system to tackle, and we'll break down each step so you can master this skill. So, let's jump right in and make math a little less mysterious, shall we?</p>
<h2>The Challenge: Our System of Equations</h2>
<p>Okay, so here's the system we're going to solve. We've got two equations with two unknowns, <em><strong>x</strong></em> and <em><strong>y</strong></em>. Our mission? Find the values of <em><strong>x</strong></em> and <em><strong>y</strong></em> that make both equations true. Think of it like finding the sweet spot where both equations agree. Solving systems of equations is a fundamental concept in algebra and has numerous applications in various fields, from engineering to economics. The ability to find solutions for multiple equations simultaneously is crucial for modeling real-world scenarios and making accurate predictions. For instance, in engineering, solving systems of equations helps determine the stresses and strains in structures, ensuring their stability and safety. In economics, it can be used to analyze supply and demand curves, predict market equilibrium, and inform policy decisions. Understanding these principles not only enhances your mathematical toolkit but also provides a valuable framework for problem-solving in diverse contexts. Mastering the art of solving systems of equations opens doors to more advanced mathematical concepts and real-world applications, making it an indispensable skill for anyone pursuing further studies or a career in STEM fields. So, let's keep our focus sharp and dive into the methods we can use to tackle this challenge effectively. This journey into algebra is more than just about numbers; it's about building a foundation for future problem-solving endeavors.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">12x + 15y = 34
-6x + 5y = 3
</code></pre>
<p>Our goal is to find the values for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> that satisfy both of these equations simultaneously. This might seem tricky at first, but don't worry, we've got strategies to make it much easier. We're going to explore a couple of common methods: the substitution method and the elimination method. Each has its strengths, and depending on the equations, one might be more straightforward than the other. We will walk through each method in detail, illustrating how to manipulate the equations to isolate variables and ultimately arrive at our solutions. So, buckle up, because we are about to dive into the world of algebraic manipulation and problem-solving strategies. Together, we'll dissect each equation, find the hidden patterns, and reveal the values of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> that make our system balanced and true. This is where the magic of math comes to life, turning abstract symbols into concrete solutions.</p>
<h2>Method 1: Elimination – Zapping Away Variables</h2>
<p>The <strong>elimination method</strong> is a super cool technique where we manipulate the equations so that when we add them together, one of the variables magically disappears – <em>poof!</em>. To get there, we often need to multiply one or both equations by a constant. The idea is to create opposite coefficients for either <em><strong>x</strong></em> or <em><strong>y</strong></em>. This allows us to eliminate one variable and solve for the other. The beauty of the elimination method lies in its simplicity and elegance. It's like performing a mathematical magic trick, where careful manipulation leads to a surprising and satisfying result. Imagine you're a mathematical wizard, and the equations are your spells. By multiplying and adding them in the right way, you can banish one variable to the mathematical netherworld, leaving you with a single equation that's much easier to handle. This approach not only simplifies the problem but also provides a clear and structured way to solve complex systems of equations. So, let's wield our mathematical wands and see how we can make the elimination method work for our system. We'll start by carefully examining the equations, looking for the most strategic way to create those opposite coefficients. Once we've identified our target variable, we'll perform the necessary manipulations, and watch as the magic unfolds. The elimination method is not just a tool; it's an art form, a way to transform a seemingly complex problem into a series of manageable steps. So, let's embrace the challenge and master this powerful technique together.</p>
<p>In our case, notice that the coefficients of <em>x</em> are 12 and -6. We can easily make these opposites by multiplying the second equation by 2. This gives us:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">2 * (-6x + 5y) = 2 * 3
-12x + 10y = 6
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we have a new equation that's equivalent to the original but has a crucial difference: the coefficient of <em>x</em> is -12, which is the opposite of 12 in our first equation. This sets the stage for the elimination magic to happen. We've strategically positioned our equations so that when we combine them, the <em>x</em> terms will cancel out, leaving us with a simpler equation involving only <em>y</em>. This is the heart of the elimination method: transforming the system into a form where one variable disappears, making the problem much easier to solve. Think of it like setting up a domino effect; each step carefully prepares the next, leading to the final solution. By multiplying the second equation by 2, we've created the perfect alignment for the <em>x</em> terms to eliminate each other. This clever manipulation demonstrates the power of algebraic thinking, where we use operations to reshape equations and reveal their hidden solutions. So, with our equations now primed and ready, let's move on to the next step and witness the elegance of the elimination method in action.</p>
<p>Now, we add this modified equation to the first original equation:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">(12x + 15y) + (-12x + 10y) = 34 + 6
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the <em>x</em> terms neatly cancel out: 12<em>x</em> + (-12<em>x</em>) = 0. This is precisely what we aimed for when we chose to multiply the second equation by 2. The elimination of the <em>x</em> variable is a key step in simplifying the system, allowing us to focus on solving for <em>y</em>. It's like filtering out the noise to reveal the underlying signal. By strategically manipulating the equations, we've created a scenario where the <em>x</em> variable acts as a bridge, disappearing to connect the <em>y</em> terms directly. This not only simplifies the algebra but also provides a clear path towards finding the value of <em>y</em>. The beauty of this method lies in its systematic approach, where each step is designed to bring us closer to the solution. The cancellation of the <em>x</em> terms is a visual confirmation that our strategy is working, a moment of mathematical satisfaction. So, with the <em>x</em> variable out of the picture, we're now left with a straightforward equation in terms of <em>y</em>, which we can easily solve. Let's continue our journey and unlock the value of <em>y</em>.</p>
<p>Simplifying, we get:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">25y = 40
</code></pre>
<p>Dividing both sides by 25, we find:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">y = 40 / 25 = 8 / 5
</code></pre>
<p>Woohoo! We've found the value of <em>y</em>! This is a major milestone in our journey to solve the system of equations. The hard work of manipulating and combining the equations has paid off, revealing the numerical value that <em>y</em> must take to satisfy both original equations. Think of this moment as reaching the peak of a challenging climb, where the view is both rewarding and exhilarating. The fraction 8/5 might look a bit unconventional, but it's a perfectly valid solution, and we're one step closer to completing our puzzle. Now that we know <em>y</em>, we can use this information to find <em>x</em>. This is where the power of solving systems of equations truly shines – each solution we find unlocks the path to finding the others. So, with <em>y</em> securely in our grasp, let's move on to the final stage: discovering the value of <em>x</em> that, together with <em>y</em> = 8/5, makes our system of equations sing in harmony.</p>
<p>Now that we know <em>y</em>, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for <em>x</em>. Let's use the second equation:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">-6x + 5 * (8 / 5) = 3
-6x + 8 = 3
-6x = -5
x = -5 / -6 = 5 / 6
</code></pre>
<p>Awesome! We've found <em>x</em> too! This marks the triumphant conclusion of our mathematical quest. With both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in hand, we've successfully cracked the code of our system of equations. The journey, though challenging, has been immensely rewarding, and we've demonstrated the power of the elimination method in action. Think of this moment as placing the final piece in a complex jigsaw puzzle, where everything clicks perfectly into place. The values <em>x</em> = 5/6 and <em>y</em> = 8/5 are not just numbers; they're the keys that unlock the harmony of the equations, ensuring that both hold true simultaneously. This accomplishment is a testament to our algebraic skills and our persistence in problem-solving. Now, with our solutions proudly displayed, let's take a moment to appreciate the beauty and precision of mathematics, and the satisfaction of a job well done. But before we celebrate fully, let's take the crucial step of verifying our solutions, ensuring that they truly fit the puzzle we've been working on.</p>
<h2>Method 2: Substitution – The Art of Swapping Variables</h2>
<p>The <strong>substitution method</strong> is another fantastic way to solve systems of equations. In this method, we solve one equation for one variable and then substitute that expression into the other equation. This effectively turns our two-variable problem into a single-variable problem, which is much easier to handle. The key to success with the substitution method is choosing the right variable to isolate and substitute. Ideally, we want to pick a variable that has a simple coefficient (like 1 or -1) in one of the equations, as this will minimize the chances of dealing with messy fractions. The substitution method is like a mathematical chameleon, adapting the equations to suit our needs. It allows us to reshape the problem, transforming it into a more manageable form. Think of it like carefully rearranging pieces in a puzzle to create a clearer picture. By isolating one variable and substituting its equivalent expression into the other equation, we're essentially streamlining the problem, eliminating one unknown and focusing on the remaining one. This approach not only simplifies the algebra but also provides a different perspective on the relationships between the variables. So, let's explore how we can apply this method to our system of equations, carefully selecting our target variable and preparing for the substitution magic to unfold.</p>
<p>Looking at our equations:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">12x + 15y = 34
-6x + 5y = 3
</code></pre>
<p>The second equation seems easier to manipulate. Let's solve it for <em>y</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">5y = 6x + 3
y = (6x + 3) / 5
</code></pre>
<p>Excellent! We've successfully isolated <em>y</em> in terms of <em>x</em>. This is a pivotal step in the substitution method, as we've now expressed one variable as a function of the other. Think of this as creating a mathematical bridge, connecting <em>y</em> to <em>x</em> in a clear and concise way. The expression <em>y</em> = (6<em>x</em> + 3) / 5 is our key to unlocking the solution, as it allows us to replace <em>y</em> in the first equation with an equivalent expression involving only <em>x</em>. This substitution will transform our two-variable problem into a single-variable equation, making it much easier to solve. The beauty of this approach lies in its elegance and efficiency. By carefully manipulating the equations, we've created a path towards simplification, streamlining the problem and focusing our efforts on a single variable. So, with our expression for <em>y</em> in hand, let's proceed to the next step: substituting it into the first equation and watching the substitution magic unfold. This is where the power of algebra truly shines, as we transform complex equations into manageable solutions.</p>
<p>Now, substitute this expression for <em>y</em> into the first equation:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">12x + 15 * ((6x + 3) / 5) = 34
</code></pre>
<p>This might look a bit intimidating, but don't worry, we'll simplify it step by step. The key here is to carefully distribute and combine like terms. This is where our algebraic skills come into play, as we navigate the equation and reshape it into a more manageable form. Think of this process as untangling a knot, carefully teasing apart the strands until the solution becomes clear. The substitution of <em>y</em> = (6<em>x</em> + 3) / 5 into the first equation is a crucial step, as it transforms our two-variable problem into a single-variable equation. This is the essence of the substitution method: reducing complexity by eliminating one variable and focusing on the other. The equation we've obtained might look a bit daunting at first, but with careful manipulation, we'll soon reveal its hidden solution. So, let's roll up our sleeves and tackle this simplification, using our knowledge of algebraic operations to unlock the value of <em>x</em>. Each step we take brings us closer to the final answer, and the satisfaction of solving a challenging equation is well worth the effort.</p>
<p>Simplifying, we get:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">12x + 3 * (6x + 3) = 34
12x + 18x + 9 = 34
30x = 25
x = 25 / 30 = 5 / 6
</code></pre>
<p>Fantastic! We've found <em>x</em> using the substitution method! It's like discovering a hidden treasure, the numerical value that satisfies our equation. This is a testament to the power of algebraic manipulation and the elegance of the substitution method. The journey might have involved a few twists and turns, but the result is well worth the effort. With <em>x</em> = 5/6 in hand, we're one step closer to solving our system of equations completely. Think of this moment as reaching a crucial milestone in a marathon, where the finish line is now within sight. The fraction 5/6 might seem unassuming, but it's a key piece of our puzzle, a fundamental value that connects the two equations. Now that we know <em>x</em>, we can use it to find <em>y</em>, completing our solution and bringing harmony to our system of equations. So, with <em>x</em> securely in our grasp, let's move on to the final stage: substituting it back into our expression for <em>y</em> and revealing the value that completes our mathematical masterpiece.</p>
<p>Now, substitute <em>x</em> = 5 / 6 back into our expression for <em>y</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">y = (6 * (5 / 6) + 3) / 5
y = (5 + 3) / 5
y = 8 / 5
</code></pre>
<p>Yes! We've found <em>y</em> too! This is the grand finale of our substitution journey, the moment where all the pieces fall into place and our system of equations is solved. The values <em>x</em> = 5/6 and <em>y</em> = 8/5 are the keys that unlock the harmony of the equations, ensuring that both hold true simultaneously. Think of this as the triumphant conclusion of a complex symphony, where each note plays its part perfectly to create a beautiful and satisfying whole. The substitution method has proven its power once again, guiding us through the algebraic maze and revealing the solutions we sought. This accomplishment is a testament to our mathematical skills and our ability to persevere through challenges. Now, with our solutions proudly displayed, let's take a moment to appreciate the elegance and precision of mathematics, and the satisfaction of a job well done. But before we celebrate fully, let's take the crucial step of verifying our solutions, ensuring that they truly fit the puzzle we've been working on.</p>
<h2>Verification: Are We Sure?</h2>
<p>It's always a good idea to double-check our answers. Let's plug <em>x</em> = 5 / 6 and <em>y</em> = 8 / 5 back into the original equations to make sure they hold true. This is like putting our solution to the ultimate test, ensuring that it truly fits the system we've been working with. Verification is a crucial step in problem-solving, as it helps us catch any potential errors and build confidence in our results. Think of it as a safety net, preventing us from falling into the trap of incorrect solutions. By plugging our values back into the original equations, we're essentially asking the question,</p>
