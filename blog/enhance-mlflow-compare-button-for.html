<p>In the realm of machine learning, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs), the ability to efficiently evaluate and compare model performance is paramount. This article proposes a significant enhancement to MLflow, a popular open-source platform for managing the ML lifecycle, by introducing a <strong>Compare button</strong> feature within the Traces view. This addition aims to streamline the process of comparing outputs from multiple traces, enabling developers to make informed decisions when selecting the best model for their specific use case. The current MLflow interface lacks a direct method for side-by-side comparison of traces, making it challenging to evaluate different models effectively. Imagine you're working with multiple versions of a language model, such as <code>gpt-4.1-mini</code> and <code>gpt-4.1-nano</code>, and you need to determine which performs better at extracting structured information from documents like invoices or menus. Currently, you'd have to manually open each trace, scroll through the JSON responses, and attempt to compare them in your head or using external tools. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. The proposed <strong>Compare button</strong> would allow users to select multiple traces and view their inputs, outputs, and execution times side by side, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of model evaluation. This feature is particularly valuable for teams working on LLM and VLM projects, where the nuances in model performance can have a significant impact on the overall application. By extending MLflow's capabilities to better support LangChain trace outputs, especially with multimodal inputs, we can make the platform an even more indispensable tool for the machine learning community. The core idea is to add a <strong>Compare button</strong> to the Traces tab UI. This button will empower users to select two or more trace rows and then view a side-by-side comparison of critical information, including the model name used (run_name), input data (such as text and image references), and the output/response content. This enhancement will not only save time but also reduce the risk of errors in model evaluation, leading to better model selection and improved overall performance.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<h3>The Need for Efficient Model Comparison</h3>
<p>In the fast-evolving landscape of machine learning, the ability to efficiently compare different models is crucial for selecting the optimal solution for a given task. <strong>Model comparison</strong> becomes particularly vital when dealing with LLMs and VLMs, where subtle differences in model architecture and training data can lead to significant variations in performance. Consider a scenario where you're developing an application that uses a VLM to extract information from visual documents, such as invoices or menus. You might have several model options available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. To make an informed decision, you need to evaluate how each model performs on your specific dataset and identify the one that provides the best balance of accuracy, speed, and cost. Without a dedicated comparison tool, this process can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Developers often resort to manually inspecting individual trace outputs, which is not only tedious but also prone to human error. The proposed <strong>Compare button</strong> feature in MLflow addresses this critical need by providing a streamlined and intuitive way to compare multiple traces side by side. By allowing users to quickly view and contrast key information such as model name, input data, and output content, this feature significantly accelerates the model evaluation process. This efficiency gain translates into faster development cycles, reduced costs, and ultimately, better model performance. Furthermore, the <strong>Compare button</strong> enhances collaboration among team members by providing a standardized way to evaluate models and share findings. This is particularly important in larger organizations where multiple teams may be working on different aspects of the same project. By providing a common platform for model comparison, MLflow fosters a more collaborative and data-driven approach to machine learning development. The ability to compare the outputs of different GPT variants side-by-side is a crucial aspect of our workflow. Without a native comparison feature, the process involves manually opening each trace and scrolling through the JSON response, which is both time-consuming and error-prone. The <strong>Compare button</strong> directly addresses this pain point, enabling a more efficient and accurate evaluation process. The current interface limitation, where only one trace can be viewed at a time, makes it difficult to get a holistic view of model performance. The absence of an option to select multiple traces and compare their inputs, outputs, or execution times hinders the ability to make informed decisions quickly. The <strong>Compare button</strong> bridges this gap by providing a unified view of multiple traces, facilitating a more comprehensive and efficient evaluation process.</p>
<h3>Use Case: Vision Language Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>Let's delve deeper into a specific use case to illustrate the value of the proposed <strong>Compare button</strong>. Imagine you're tasked with building an application that automatically extracts structured data from invoices. This is a common business challenge that can be addressed using VLMs, which combine natural language processing and computer vision capabilities to understand both text and images. You might be considering different VLM options, such as <code>gpt-4.1-mini</code> and <code>gpt-4.1-nano</code>, each with its own trade-offs in terms of accuracy, speed, and cost. To determine which model is best suited for your application, you need to evaluate their performance on a representative sample of invoices. This involves feeding the models the same invoice images and comparing their outputs to identify any discrepancies or errors. Without the <strong>Compare button</strong>, this process would require manually opening each trace, examining the JSON responses, and comparing them side by side. This is not only tedious but also introduces the risk of human error, especially when dealing with complex JSON structures. The <strong>Compare button</strong> streamlines this process by allowing you to select multiple traces corresponding to different model runs and view their outputs side by side. This allows you to quickly identify differences in the extracted data, such as missing fields, incorrect values, or formatting errors. You can also compare the execution times of different models to assess their performance in terms of speed. By providing a clear and concise view of the model outputs, the <strong>Compare button</strong> empowers you to make informed decisions about model selection. You can easily identify the model that provides the best balance of accuracy, speed, and cost for your specific use case. This leads to improved application performance, reduced development costs, and ultimately, better business outcomes. Moreover, the <strong>Compare button</strong> facilitates collaboration among team members by providing a standardized way to evaluate model performance. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and that decisions are based on objective data rather than subjective opinions. The <strong>Compare button</strong> would allow users to select two or more trace rows and view a side-by-side comparison of model names, input (text and image references), and output/response content, making this evaluation process much more efficient.</p>
<h3>Why This Matters for MLflow Users</h3>
<p>The proposed <strong>Compare button</strong> is not just a minor convenience; it represents a significant enhancement to MLflow's capabilities, making it an even more valuable tool for a wider range of users. By extending MLflow's functionality to better support LangChain trace outputs, particularly with multimodal inputs, we're addressing a critical need in the rapidly growing field of LLM and VLM development. As these models become more prevalent in various applications, the ability to efficiently evaluate and compare their performance becomes increasingly important. The <strong>Compare button</strong> directly addresses this need, making MLflow a more indispensable platform for teams working on these cutting-edge technologies. Furthermore, the <strong>Compare button</strong> aligns with MLflow's core mission of simplifying the machine learning lifecycle. By streamlining the model evaluation process, this feature helps users to iterate more quickly, experiment with different models, and ultimately, build better applications. This increased efficiency translates into reduced development costs, faster time to market, and improved overall results. The value of the <strong>Compare button</strong> extends beyond individual users and benefits entire organizations. By providing a standardized and efficient way to evaluate models, this feature fosters a more data-driven and collaborative approach to machine learning development. This leads to better decision-making, improved model performance, and ultimately, a stronger competitive advantage. In addition to the immediate benefits, the <strong>Compare button</strong> also lays the foundation for future enhancements to MLflow's trace evaluation capabilities. For example, it could be extended to support more advanced comparison metrics, such as semantic similarity scores or qualitative assessments. This would further enhance MLflow's ability to provide comprehensive and insightful model evaluations. The current manual process of comparing model outputs is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. The <strong>Compare button</strong> automates and streamlines this process, saving users valuable time and reducing the risk of mistakes. This increased efficiency allows developers to focus on other critical tasks, such as model development and feature engineering. The enhanced efficiency and accuracy provided by the <strong>Compare button</strong> lead to better model selection, which translates into improved application performance and better business outcomes. This makes MLflow an even more valuable tool for organizations looking to leverage the power of machine learning.</p>
<h2>Details of the Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>The core of the proposal is to introduce a <strong>Compare button</strong> within the Traces tab UI of MLflow. This button will serve as the entry point for users to initiate the trace comparison process. The functionality will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily select the traces they want to compare and view the results in a clear and concise manner. When a user clicks the <strong>Compare button</strong>, they will be presented with a selection interface, allowing them to choose two or more trace rows from the displayed list. The interface should provide clear visual cues to indicate which traces have been selected, such as highlighting or checkmarks. Once the user has selected the desired traces, they can proceed to the comparison view, which will present the information side by side for easy comparison. The comparison view will display key information from each selected trace, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model name used (run_name):</strong> This allows users to quickly identify which model generated each trace.</li>
<li><strong>Input data (e.g., text and image references):</strong> This shows the input that was fed into the model, allowing users to understand the context of the output.</li>
<li><strong>Output/response content:</strong> This displays the model's response or output, which is the primary focus of the comparison.</li>
</ul>
<p>The side-by-side presentation will allow users to quickly identify differences and similarities between the traces. The layout should be designed to maximize readability and minimize visual clutter. For example, the information could be presented in a table format, with each trace occupying a column and the different data points (model name, input, output) occupying rows. In addition to the core information, the comparison view could also include other relevant details, such as execution time, latency, or other performance metrics. This would provide users with a more comprehensive view of the trace data and facilitate a more informed comparison. The implementation of the <strong>Compare button</strong> feature will require modifications to both the front-end UI and the back-end API of MLflow. The front-end changes will involve adding the button to the Traces tab, creating the selection interface, and designing the comparison view. The back-end changes will involve adding an API endpoint to retrieve the data for multiple traces and format it for the comparison view. The specific technical details of the implementation will depend on the existing architecture of MLflow and the chosen technologies. However, the goal is to ensure that the implementation is efficient, scalable, and maintainable. The proposed <strong>Compare button</strong> feature represents a significant enhancement to MLflow's trace evaluation capabilities. By providing a streamlined and intuitive way to compare multiple traces, this feature will empower users to make more informed decisions about model selection and improve the overall performance of their machine learning applications.</p>
<h2>Affected Components and Interfaces</h2>
<p>The proposed <strong>Compare button</strong> feature will primarily impact the tracing components of MLflow, specifically the user interface (UI) and the underlying tracing APIs. This enhancement is directly related to improving the user experience when analyzing and comparing traces generated by LangChain and other LLM-based applications. The following components and interfaces are expected to be affected:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>area/tracing</code>:</strong> This component encompasses MLflow's tracing features, tracing APIs, and LLM tracing functionality. The <strong>Compare button</strong> will leverage the existing tracing APIs to retrieve trace data and present it in a side-by-side comparison view.</li>
<li><strong><code>area/uiux</code>:</strong> This component covers the front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, and JavaScript dev server aspects of MLflow. The addition of the <strong>Compare button</strong> will require modifications to the Traces tab UI, including the button itself, the trace selection interface, and the comparison view.</li>
</ul>
<p>In more detail, the <code>area/tracing</code> component will need to be updated to provide an API endpoint that can efficiently retrieve data for multiple traces based on user selection. This API will likely involve querying the underlying trace storage (e.g., a database or file system) and aggregating the relevant information for each trace, such as model name, input, output, and execution time. The retrieved data will then be formatted and returned to the UI for display. On the <code>area/uiux</code> side, the primary task will be to design and implement the user interface elements for the <strong>Compare button</strong> feature. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a <strong>Compare button</strong> to the Traces tab UI.</li>
<li>Creating a trace selection interface that allows users to easily choose the traces they want to compare.</li>
<li>Developing a comparison view that presents the selected traces side by side, displaying key information in a clear and concise manner.</li>
<li>Ensuring the UI is responsive and handles different screen sizes and resolutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The UI implementation will likely involve using JavaScript and a front-end framework such as React or Vue.js. The design should follow MLflow's existing UI conventions and guidelines to ensure a consistent user experience. While the core impact is on the tracing and UI/UX components, there may be secondary effects on other areas of MLflow as well. For example, if the trace storage mechanism needs to be optimized to support the <strong>Compare button</strong> feature, there could be implications for the <code>area/server-infra</code> component, which handles the MLflow Tracking server backend. Similarly, if the new API endpoint requires changes to the authentication or authorization mechanisms, there could be impacts on the security-related components of MLflow. However, these secondary effects are expected to be minimal, and the primary focus will be on the tracing and UI/UX components. The proposed changes are not expected to have a significant impact on other areas of MLflow, such as model registry, deployments, or projects. The <strong>Compare button</strong> is primarily focused on enhancing the trace evaluation experience, which is a distinct aspect of the MLflow platform.</p>

<p>The addition of a <strong>Compare button</strong> to MLflow's Traces view represents a valuable enhancement that will significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of model evaluation, particularly for LLM and VLM projects. By enabling users to easily compare multiple traces side by side, this feature addresses a critical need in the machine learning workflow and aligns with MLflow's mission of simplifying the ML lifecycle. The <strong>Compare button</strong> will empower developers to make more informed decisions about model selection, leading to improved application performance and better business outcomes. This enhancement will benefit individual users, teams, and organizations by fostering a more data-driven and collaborative approach to machine learning development. The changes primarily affect the <code>area/tracing</code> and <code>area/uiux</code> components of MLflow, with minimal impact on other areas of the platform. The proposed solution involves adding a <strong>Compare button</strong> to the Traces tab UI, creating a trace selection interface, and developing a comparison view that presents key information from selected traces in a clear and concise manner. The implementation will require modifications to both the front-end UI and the back-end API of MLflow. Overall, the <strong>Compare button</strong> feature is a worthwhile addition to MLflow that will enhance its usability and value for the machine learning community. It will streamline the model evaluation process, reduce the risk of errors, and ultimately, help users build better machine learning applications. This feature is particularly important in the rapidly growing field of LLM and VLM development, where the ability to efficiently compare model performance is crucial for success. By providing a standardized and intuitive way to evaluate models, the <strong>Compare button</strong> will make MLflow an even more indispensable tool for teams working on these cutting-edge technologies. The proposed enhancement is a step forward in making MLflow a more comprehensive and user-friendly platform for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle.</p>
