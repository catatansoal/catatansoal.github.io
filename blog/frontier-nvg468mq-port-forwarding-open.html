title="Frontier NVG468MQ Port Forwarding: Open But Blocked?\n\nHey guys, ever tried to set up *port forwarding* on your *Frontier Arris NVG468MQ router* only to find that even though a port tester says it&#39;s open, you *still can&#39;t access your service externally*? Trust me, you&#39;re not alone! This is a *super common headache* for anyone trying to expose a home service like an *SSH server* running on an *Intel NUC with Arch Linux* to the wider internet. It’s frustrating, bewildering, and honestly, a bit soul-crushing when you’ve followed all the steps and it just… doesn&#39;t work. But don&#39;t throw your *Frontier NVG468MQ* out the window just yet! We&#39;re gonna dive deep into why this happens and, more importantly, how to fix it. We’ll cover everything from double NAT issues and *ISP-level blocking* to a deep dive into your router settings and *Linux firewall configurations*. The goal? To get your *SSH service* (or whatever cool thing you’re running) *accessible from anywhere*, securely and reliably. This isn&#39;t just about tweaking a setting; it&#39;s about understanding the entire network path, from your device all the way to the public internet, and identifying exactly where the block is happening. We’re talking about unraveling the mystery of that *stubbornly blocked port* on your *Frontier Arris NVG468MQ*. So, grab a coffee, and let’s get your network straightened out!\n\n## Understanding Port Forwarding Basics (and Why It&#39;s Tricky)\n\nLet&#39;s kick things off by making sure we&#39;re all on the same page about *port forwarding*. In simple terms, *port forwarding* is like telling your *router* (in our case, the *Frontier Arris NVG468MQ*) that when it receives a request for a specific service on a specific &quot;door&quot; (a port number, like our *SSH port XX22*) from the internet, it should automatically send that request to a specific device on your internal network. Think of your router as a doorman for your entire house. Normally, he doesn&#39;t let anyone in unless you explicitly ask him to. *Port forwarding* is you telling him, &quot;Hey, if someone asks for a package delivered to &#39;Port XX22&#39;, send it directly to &#39;Intel NUC&#39; inside.&quot; This is absolutely *crucial* for services like an *SSH server*, a game server, or a personal web server that you want to access from outside your home network. Without it, external requests simply hit your router and get dropped, as the router doesn&#39;t know where to send them internally. It&#39;s a fundamental networking concept, yet it’s often the source of immense frustration.\n\nOne of the main reasons *port forwarding can be so tricky* is the sheer number of places things can go wrong. It’s not just about setting up a rule on your *Frontier NVG468MQ*. You&#39;ve got your local device&#39;s firewall (like *iptables* or *nftables* on your *Arch Linux Intel NUC*), the router&#39;s own internal firewall, potential *ISP-level blocks* (especially with *Frontier* or other providers implementing *Carrier-Grade NAT* – CGNAT), and even *double NAT* scenarios if you have multiple routers in your setup. Each of these layers acts as a potential gatekeeper, and if even one of them isn&#39;t configured correctly, your *port-forwarded service* remains inaccessible. Furthermore, many *ISP-provided routers*, including the *Frontier Arris NVG468MQ*, often have simplified interfaces or hidden settings that can make granular control difficult. They are designed for ease of use for the average customer, not necessarily for power users who want to host their own services. This often means default security settings are highly restrictive, which is good for general safety but bad for *port forwarding*. Understanding these layers is the first step in effectively troubleshooting why your *port XX22* might be *open on a port checker* but still *blocked externally* for your *SSH service*. It&#39;s a multi-faceted problem, and we need to systematically eliminate each potential bottleneck to get your setup working as smoothly as possible. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll break down each one.\n\n## The Core Problem: Port Open, But Still Blocked Externally\n\nOkay, let&#39;s zero in on the head-scratcher: you&#39;ve diligently set up *port forwarding* on your *Frontier NVG468MQ*, used an *online port checker* (like CanYouSeeMe.org or PortChecker.co) and it screams &quot;Success! Port XX22 is Open!&quot; But then you try to *SSH* into your *Intel NUC* from your phone&#39;s data connection or a friend&#39;s house, and bam! Connection refused, timeout, nothing. What gives? This specific *Frontier Arris NVG468MQ port forwarding* issue is incredibly common and super misleading. The *port checker* tells you the port is *reachable from the outside* to your *router*, which is great news – it means your *Frontier NVG468MQ* is indeed listening and attempting to forward the request. However, the problem lies somewhere between your router and the actual service on your *Intel NUC*, or even before your router entirely.\n\nThe most common culprits for this &quot;open but blocked&quot; *Frontier NVG468MQ* scenario fall into a few categories. First up, we&#39;ve got *double NAT*. This happens when you have two devices performing network address translation (NAT) on your network. Maybe you have the *Frontier NVG468MQ* acting as a router, and then *another personal router* connected to it, or perhaps an *ONT/modem combo unit* from *Frontier* that&#39;s also doing NAT before passing off to the *NVG468MQ*. If your *Intel NUC* is behind the *second NAT layer*, the *port forwarding* on the *NVG468MQ* will only direct traffic to the *second router*, which then doesn&#39;t know what to do with it. We&#39;ll show you how to check for this. Secondly, it could be your *ISP, Frontier*, actively blocking the port, or more commonly, using *Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)*. With CGNAT, your *Frontier NVG468MQ* doesn&#39;t get a truly public IP address; instead, it shares one with many other customers. This makes *inbound connections* impossible or extremely difficult without their help. While your port checker might see *Frontier&#39;s shared public IP*, the traffic never makes it to your home. Thirdly, and often overlooked, is the *device&#39;s own firewall*. Even if your *Frontier router* forwards the *SSH request* to your *Intel NUC*, if *Arch Linux&#39;s firewall (iptables/nftables)* isn&#39;t configured to allow *inbound SSH connections* on *port XX22*, the connection will be dropped right at the NUC itself. We&#39;re talking about a multi-layered defense system, and you need to ensure every single gate is open for your specific *SSH service*. Lastly, sometimes *Frontier routers* can be a bit quirky with their *firmware* or have *security features* that interfere, even if *port forwarding* seems correctly configured. We need to be systematic and check each point of failure to pinpoint why your *SSH port* is playing hard to get.\n\n## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting for Your Frontier NVG468MQ Router\n\nAlright, guys, let’s roll up our sleeves and get practical. This is where we systematically go through every potential choke point to get your *port forwarding working* on your *Frontier Arris NVG468MQ*. We&#39;ll cover everything from confirming your network setup to digging into your *Intel NUC&#39;s Linux firewall*.\n\n### Confirming Your Router&#39;s IP Address and Local Network Setup\n\nThe very first thing you need to check is your *public IP address* and your *router&#39;s WAN IP*. Sometimes, these aren&#39;t the same, which is a big red flag for *double NAT* or *CGNAT* (Carrier-Grade NAT) from *Frontier*.\n\n1.  **Find Your Public IP:** Go to a site like whatismyipaddress.com from a device connected to your *Frontier NVG468MQ*. Note this IP address down. This is what the outside world sees.\n2.  **Find Your Router&#39;s WAN IP:** Log into your *Frontier NVG468MQ router&#39;s administration page*. Usually, you can access it by typing `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.254.254` (check the sticker on your router) into your web browser. Look for a &quot;WAN Status,&quot; &quot;Internet Connection,&quot; or &quot;External IP Address&quot; section.\n3.  **Compare IPs:**\n    *   If the *public IP* (from step 1) matches your *router&#39;s WAN IP* (from step 2), great! You likely don&#39;t have a *double NAT* issue or *CGNAT* *at this layer*.\n    *   If they *do not match*, it means there&#39;s another router or a *CGNAT* setup between your *Frontier NVG468MQ* and the public internet. If it&#39;s another router you control, you&#39;ll need to set it to bridge mode or *port forward* from it to your *NVG468MQ*. If it&#39;s *CGNAT from Frontier*, things get trickier, and we&#39;ll discuss options later. For now, acknowledge this potential hurdle.\n\nNext, ensure your *Intel NUC* has a *static IP address*. If its IP changes, your *port forwarding rule* on the *Frontier NVG468MQ* will point to the wrong device! On *Arch Linux*, you can set a static IP via `netctl` or `NetworkManager`. For example, a basic `netctl` profile might look like this:\n\n```\nDescription=&#39;A static IP profile&#39;\nInterface=enp1s0 # Your NUC&#39;s network interface, check with &#39;ip a&#39;\nConnection=ethernet\nIP=static\nAddress=(&#39;192.168.1.100/24&#39;) # Choose an IP outside your router&#39;s DHCP range\nGateway=&#39;192.168.1.1&#39; # Your Frontier NVG468MQ&#39;s IP\nDNS=(&#39;8.8.8.8&#39; &#39;8.8.4.4&#39;)\n```\nApply this by disabling DHCP and enabling your static profile. This ensures your *Intel NUC* is always at `192.168.1.100` (or whatever you pick). This step is *absolutely critical* for reliable *port forwarding*.\n\n### Inside the Frontier NVG468MQ: Port Forwarding Settings Deep Dive\n\nNow, let&#39;s get into the guts of your *Frontier NVG468MQ router*. The interface can be a bit clunky, but we’ll navigate it together.\n\n1.  **Access Router Interface:** Open your web browser and go to `http://192.168.1.1` (or your router&#39;s default gateway IP). Enter your admin username and password. This info is usually on a sticker on the router itself.\n2.  **Navigate to Port Forwarding:** Look for sections like &quot;Firewall,&quot; &quot;Port Forwarding,&quot; &quot;Virtual Servers,&quot; or &quot;Advanced Settings.&quot; On the *NVG468MQ*, it&#39;s often under &quot;Firewall&quot; then &quot;Port Forwarding.&quot;.\n3.  **Create/Verify the Rule:**\n    *   You&#39;ll need to create a new rule for your *SSH service* on *port XX22*.\n    *   **Application Name:** Something descriptive, like &quot;NUC SSH.&quot;\n    *   **Protocol:** Select &quot;TCP.&quot; *SSH* uses TCP.\n    *   **External Port (or &quot;WAN Port&quot;):** This is the port the outside world will use. Enter *XX22*.\n    *   **Internal Port (or &quot;LAN Port&quot;):** This is the port your *Intel NUC&#39;s SSH server* is actually listening on. Usually, this is also *XX22*.\n    *   **Device/Internal IP Address:** This is where you enter the *static IP address* of your *Intel NUC* (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) that you set up in the previous step. **This is a common mistake point!** Make sure it&#39;s correct.\n    *   **Enable/Save:** Make sure the rule is enabled and then save your changes. The *Frontier NVG468MQ* might require a reboot to apply changes, so consider doing that if issues persist.\n4.  **Router&#39;s Internal Firewall:** Sometimes, the *Frontier NVG468MQ* has a separate &quot;Firewall Level&quot; setting. Ensure it&#39;s not set to &quot;High&quot; or &quot;Strict,&quot; which could override your *port forwarding* rules. Temporarily setting it to &quot;Medium&quot; or &quot;Low&quot; might help test if this is the culprit, but remember to re-evaluate your security afterward. You might also find options like &quot;UPnP&quot; (Universal Plug and Play); while convenient, it&#39;s generally not recommended for security reasons, but you can try enabling it *temporarily* for your *SSH* port to see if it bypasses an issue, then disable it and set up the rule manually.\n\nThis deep dive into the *Frontier NVG468MQ&#39;s* specific settings is crucial. Many users find the interface confusing, and subtle misconfigurations here are a leading cause of *blocked external access*.\n\n### Checking Your Intel NUC (Arch Linux) for Internal Blocks\n\nEven with the *Frontier NVG468MQ* forwarding correctly, your *Intel NUC* itself can be blocking the connection. This is often the case if your *port checker* says the port is open but you can&#39;t connect.\n\n1.  **SSH Service Status:** First, ensure your *SSH server* (usually `sshd`) is running and listening on *port XX22* on your *Arch Linux Intel NUC*.\n    *   Check status: `sudo systemctl status sshd`\n    *   Check listening port: `sudo ss -tulpn | grep XX22` (replace XX22 with your actual port). You should see `sshd` listening on `0.0.0.0:XX22` or `:::XX22`.\n2.  **Arch Linux Firewall (iptables/nftables):** *Arch Linux* doesn&#39;t come with a firewall enabled by default, but if you&#39;ve set one up (which you should for security!), it needs to permit *inbound connections* on *port XX22*.\n    *   **iptables:**\n        *   Check existing rules: `sudo iptables -L -v -n`\n        *   To temporarily allow (for testing): `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport XX22 -j ACCEPT`. If this fixes it, you need to make the rule persistent.\n    *   **nftables:**\n        *   Check existing rules: `sudo nft list ruleset`\n        *   Example rule for your `inet filter input` chain (adjust as per your setup): `add rule inet filter input tcp dport XX22 accept`\n    *   **UFW (if installed):**\n        *   Check status: `sudo ufw status`\n        *   Allow the port: `sudo ufw allow XX22/tcp`\n    *   **SELinux/AppArmor:** These are less common on *Arch Linux* but check if you&#39;ve installed them. They can restrict which ports applications can bind to. If you have them, temporarily disable them for testing only.\n3.  **Local Test:** From another device on your *internal network*, try to *SSH* to your *Intel NUC*&#39;s internal IP (`ssh user@192.168.1.100 -p XX22`). If this works, your *NUC&#39;s SSH server* and *local firewall* are probably okay, and the problem is higher up (router or *ISP*). If this *doesn&#39;t* work, the problem is definitely on your *Intel NUC*.\n\nBy systematically checking these *Linux-specific configurations*, you can eliminate the *Intel NUC* itself as the source of the *blocked external access* for your *SSH service*.\n\n### The ISP Factor: Is Frontier Blocking Your Ports?\n\nThis is often the most frustrating part: when everything on your end seems perfect, but *Frontier* is the one throwing a wrench in your *port forwarding* plans.\n\n1.  **Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT):** This is the big one. If your *router&#39;s WAN IP* (from Step 3.1) is a private IP address (like `10.x.x.x`, `100.64.x.x` to `100.127.x.x`, or `172.16.x.x` to `172.31.x.x`), then *Frontier* is most likely using *CGNAT*. This means many *Frontier* customers share a single public IP address, and *inbound connections* from the internet are simply not possible in the traditional sense, as *Frontier&#39;s* own large-scale NAT device won&#39;t know which customer&#39;s *Frontier NVG468MQ* to forward the *SSH request* to.\n2.  **ISP Blocking Specific Ports:** While less common for *SSH*, some *ISPs* block certain well-known ports (like 80 for web servers, 25 for email) to prevent abuse or encourage business plans. *Frontier* generally doesn&#39;t block *SSH* by default, but it&#39;s worth considering.\n3.  **What to Do About It:**\n    *   **Call Frontier (Prepare for Battle):** You can call *Frontier support* and ask if they use *CGNAT* and if you can get a *public IP address*. Sometimes they offer a *static IP address* for a fee, which bypasses *CGNAT*. Be prepared for a long call and potentially unhelpful support. Explain you need to host a service, not just browse.\n    *   **Alternative Solutions:** If *Frontier* won&#39;t budge on *CGNAT*, you&#39;ll need a workaround. We&#39;ll discuss these in the next section.\n\nIdentifying if *Frontier* is the bottleneck is paramount. It shifts your troubleshooting from your *Frontier NVG468MQ* and *Intel NUC* to external solutions.\n\n## Advanced Strategies and Workarounds (When All Else Fails)\n\nSo, you&#39;ve checked everything, and your *Frontier Arris NVG468MQ* is still playing hard to get, or you&#39;ve confirmed *Frontier&#39;s CGNAT* is the issue. Don&#39;t despair, guys! There are still ways to get your *SSH service* accessible. These methods work around traditional *port forwarding* limitations.\n\n### DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) - Use with Extreme Caution!\n\nThe *DMZ setting* on your *Frontier NVG468MQ* basically tells the router to forward *ALL incoming traffic* to a specific internal IP address (your *Intel NUC* in this case), unless a specific *port forwarding rule* overrides it. It essentially *bypasses the router&#39;s firewall* for that one device.\n*   **How to Set Up:** On your *Frontier NVG468MQ*, look for &quot;DMZ&quot; under &quot;Firewall&quot; or &quot;Advanced Settings.&quot; Enter your *Intel NUC&#39;s static IP address* (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).\n*   **Why Caution:** Putting a device in the *DMZ* exposes it directly to the internet. This means *every single port* on your *Intel NUC* becomes externally accessible unless blocked by your *NUC&#39;s own firewall*. This dramatically increases your security risk. Only use this if you have a *very robust firewall* on your *Arch Linux NUC* and you understand the implications. It&#39;s a troubleshooting step to confirm if the *NVG468MQ* firewall is the problem, not a permanent solution for most. If your *SSH service* works in the *DMZ*, you know the *Frontier NVG468MQ&#39;s* *port forwarding* or *firewall* was the issue, and you can then focus on perfecting your *manual port forwarding rule* or exploring other solutions.\n\n### VPN-based Port Forwarding Services\n\nIf *Frontier&#39;s CGNAT* is truly the root cause, a *VPN service with port forwarding* is often the best solution.\n*   **How it Works:** You subscribe to a commercial *VPN provider* that offers *port forwarding*. Your *Intel NUC* connects to this *VPN server*. The *VPN provider* then forwards traffic from their public IP address and a specific port (which they assign to you) through their VPN tunnel directly to your *Intel NUC*.\n*   **Benefits:** Bypasses *CGNAT* entirely, as your *NUC* communicates outbound to the VPN server, and the *VPN server* handles the inbound mapping. It also adds an extra layer of encryption.\n*   **Considerations:** It&#39;s a paid service, and you&#39;ll need to run the *VPN client* on your *Intel NUC*. Ensure the *VPN provider* specifically supports *port forwarding* for the port you need (*XX22* for *SSH*). This is a reliable way to make your *SSH service* available globally even when your *Frontier NVG468MQ* can&#39;t directly handle inbound connections.\n\n### IPv6 Considerations\n\nDoes *Frontier* offer *IPv6* in your area? If so, this could be your golden ticket! *IPv6* largely bypasses the complexities of NAT because every device gets its own unique, public *IPv6 address*.\n*   **How it Works:** If your *Frontier NVG468MQ* supports *IPv6* and *Frontier* provides it, your *Intel NUC* will also receive a public *IPv6 address*. You then simply need to ensure your *Arch Linux firewall* allows *inbound SSH connections* on *port XX22* for *IPv6*. No *port forwarding* is needed on the *Frontier NVG468MQ*!\n*   **Checks:** Check your router&#39;s settings for *IPv6*. Check your *Intel NUC&#39;s* IP addresses (`ip a`) for an *IPv6 address* that isn&#39;t `fe80::/10` (link-local). If you have a public *IPv6 address*, you can then try connecting to your *NUC* using its *IPv6 address* (e.g., `ssh user@[your_ipv6_address] -p XX22`). This is often the cleanest solution if available.\n\n### Other Niche Issues and Tips\n\n*   **Firmware Updates:** Ensure your *Frontier NVG468MQ router* has the latest *firmware*. Sometimes bugs are patched that affect *port forwarding*.\n*   **Conflicting Services:** Ensure nothing else on your *Intel NUC* or network is trying to use *port XX22*.\n*   **Router Reboot:** The classic IT solution! Sometimes a simple reboot of your *Frontier NVG468MQ* can clear out transient issues and apply settings correctly.\n*   **ISP Modem/ONT in Bridge Mode:** If you have a separate modem/ONT from *Frontier* before your *NVG468MQ*, ensure the modem is in &quot;bridge mode&quot; and not acting as *another router*. This would be a *double NAT* situation.\n\nBy exploring these *advanced strategies*, you&#39;ll significantly increase your chances of making your *SSH service accessible externally*, even when your *Frontier NVG468MQ* seems to be putting up a fight. It might require a bit more effort, but getting your *Intel NUC* accessible is totally worth it!\n\n## Conclusion: Conquering Your Frontier NVG468MQ Port Forwarding Challenges\n\nWhew! We&#39;ve covered a lot of ground, haven&#39;t we, guys? Tackling *port forwarding issues* on your *Frontier Arris NVG468MQ router*, especially when your *port appears open but is still blocked externally* for a service like *SSH* on your *Intel NUC running Arch Linux*, can feel like a never-ending battle. But by systematically troubleshooting each layer – your *router&#39;s configuration*, your *Intel NUC&#39;s firewall*, and potential *ISP-level blocks* like *CGNAT* from *Frontier* – you&#39;re now armed with the knowledge to pinpoint exactly where the problem lies. Remember, persistence is key! Whether it&#39;s ensuring your *static IP is correctly set*, meticulously configuring your *Frontier NVG468MQ&#39;s port forwarding rules*, or digging into your *Arch Linux iptables*, every step brings you closer to victory. And if all else fails, don&#39;t forget those advanced workarounds like *VPN-based port forwarding* or leveraging *IPv6*. Your patience will pay off, and soon, your *SSH service* will be humming along, accessible from anywhere you need it to be. Happy networking, and here&#39;s to successfully unblocking those stubborn ports!" width="300" height="200"/>
